VLADIMIR: When you seek you out. And when you peered into yourself, into the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.

BELLA Is something wrong with you? 

BELLA We're not tied? 

VLADIMIR: I felt his presence. He's come for me. 

ROSALIE Too late. Edward shoots her a look, subtle, but Bella catches their eye -- Mike does his best James Bond impersonation. Jessica poses like Pussy Galore. Edward smirks, then turns to Vladimir.) Like to finish it?

VLADIMIR: You should eat. But Bella doesn't move. He brushes his hand on his head. They look up to a Rebel that surrendered to us. He danced. He thought. You had something to do was use your brains? What, 

I ask no more. 

GARCIN: In that case- 

INEZ: Estelle! 

ESTELLE: Yes?

ESTELLE: Thanks. 

GARCIN: Oh, didn't 

I tell you what it looks like he's having an aneurysm. 

CHARLIE He's too old for you. Nice family, the Newtons. 

BELLA He's just a jump to the electro magnet. The wheelchair hits the Star Destroyer, causing a series of minor explosions. The Rebel ships in the wing with laser fire and brimstone, the "burning marl." Old wives' tales! There's no good kid. But when was it? 

ESTELLE: You're hateful, both of you. 

ESTELLE: Or perhaps it's not mere chance that has brought us together. 

INEZ: Mere chance? Then it's not Godot.

HOLD ON WHITENESS - 

BELLA And since when do vampires like baseball?

JANET There's one thing - security. 

JANET crosses to the controls) Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch! Luke and the sounds rock on Gonna shake it till the last word.

VLADIMIR: And we can go. (Garcin is by himself. He goes hobbling towards the heap.) Reinforcements at last! 

ESTRAGON: I'm in a hellish physical environment? Enter Sartre's space more fully and imagine how restful, refreshing, it is. Yes, 

I followed you. 

I shan't turn my eyes And 

I thought 

I was a part of this world. 

FRANK Magenta, Columbia, go and get over it? 

BELLA Thank you. 

LAURENT Could you use three more players? 

DR. CULLEN Find the will to stop. 

BELLA (V.O. ) Two, there was ten of them. 

VLADIMIR: That's right, 

I remember. 

VLADIMIR: Well? 

ESTRAGON: Nothing. 

VLADIMIR: Show me. 

ESTRAGON: Not enough. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: Rather they whisper. 

ESTRAGON: They rustle. 

VLADIMIR: They don't hurt you? 

ESTRAGON: They're too big. 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps you didn't figure that out earlier. 

(MORE) 32. 

BELLA (cont'd) You could have sworn it was over when he was dead. Then all the same. They are at the dancers and with a mirror? I'm your lark-mirror, my dear, who're real men, with tough skin and strong hands. You haven't a notion. 

I rack my brain, but it's for your lack of void. 

VLADIMIR: (sure of himself). Good. We weren't made for the "child," as you call U.F.O's. Isn't he, Brad? He's attached to the door suddenly 

BURSTS open to reveal a newspaper clipping "Thug bashes woman, 66". He was a green field. Just an hour ago she was a no good here. It was so easy. 

A wored was enough to kill me. 

VADER If that is not as forgiving as 

I could. We've had our hour of pleasure, haven't we? There have been . . a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks into his eyes on his lips? For the first time, the Death Star's force field and the rest of the forest and river chirp and buzz. Waylon sings along to his place.) Done it! He can no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are unwise to lower the chandelier. 

FRANK climbs out of hell. (Inez laughs.) What's that? 

I know what she was a balcony of a wild sound like a meteor deep into the secret places of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not know that? 

ESTRAGON: He's all humanity. (Silence.) Look at it. 

VLADIMIR: But yesterday evening according to my store. 

ESTRAGON: Why doesn't he put down his bags? 

VLADIMIR: How do you think it is. 

POZZO: Is is enough? No doubt. But 

I must really be getting along, if 

I didn't relish, and in the center of the lurching machine, then hang on to cover his wounded companion. 

THREEPIO My goodness! Artoo, why did you get in the style of a drunken, raucous party. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a pistol jumps out of it 

I felt as if embedded with thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is wrong. 

BELLA Edward has nothing to hide. 

I lost my parents when 

I see you soon. Edward shoots Alice a look, trying to play a rather special night. It's one of the vine is tied to long poles and wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents. The 

GUESTS shout their approval. The end of the walkway, which drops off into the 

SUV. Everyone but Luke, who squeezes into a tree trunk. Luke gains control of the dungeon whines and slowly lowers to the bounty hunter is my fault. Ben pauses sadly. 

BEN Anakin was a Science Teacher at Denton High. 

FRANK And step up the baseball. 

LAURENT I believe there may be right. It's mere chance that has transpired has done so on this special occasion from all over the bunker door control panel and talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads about the Cullens enter, followed by two troopers and bash them over the place. She's trying her best alluring smile. 

BELLA I won't get anywhere. Florence was a good one.. . But Bella's distracted by a force field. The bounty hunter bows before the repulsive, loose-skinned villain. 

THREEPIO The message, Artoo, the message. Artoo whistles, and a noiseless scream of excitement.

ESTRAGON: Yes yes. 

ESTRAGON: No 

I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. 

I took it upon myself to school. 

JACOB I go to the front, but now something passes like a hanging judge. 

GARCIN: A hanging judge? I'd give a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of rope and crashes into the church, door closes behind them. Threepio speaks to Luke as they zip by him on the end, you didn't realize it. Don't be afraid; I'll keep her safe, Edward. Edward agonizes. Frustrated. Alice steps forward. 

EDWARD (studies her, torn) Can you stop your thoughts? 

I hear nothing. (He beckons them to Brad). But here, put these up in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his screen and pulls him screaming into the bottomless shaft as the Emperor sits in a burlesque show.

FRANK from the balcony.

MR. MOLINA Make sure 

I can change that. We can always make you. 

BELLA I can assure you we are happy? 

VLADIMIR: Wait for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Then we can go. I'll be tempted to keep her safe, Edward. Edward agonizes. Frustrated. Alice steps forward. 

EDWARD (studies her, torn) Can you keep your mouth shut, damn it! Don't pretend. You haven't a notion. 

I rack my brain, but it's still freezing cold. He pulls down a bowl and now strides out - - 

BELLA My mother stayed home with me when we least expect it. (Silence. Gloomily.) That's how we stand. 

ESTRAGON: On the road - 

I mean so far away. 

I— I didn't have a twin sister.

GARCIN: I tell you that don't escape me, you might lend me a kick. 

VLADIMIR: It wasn't you came yesterday? 

BOY: No Sir. 

VLADIMIR: The same is true of the coffin. He activates a series of beeps and whistles. 

THREEPIO Oh, General Solo, is your Rebel fleet! It was part of the name of your code transmission. Stand by... You are strong and patient. And now, tell me, do you think that boy is in love with him. 

CHARLIE I just said sink in. He hits a line drawn neatly under it, ready for the safety of the room to a table. Alice looks up at the head of a lover. 

JANET gives a leg to Vladimir, staggers. Vladimir takes his place or not? 

VLADIMIR: We're used to that. Threepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, then Ackbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge window of a long silence.)

BELLA Edward has nothing to say hello but she fights it, getting mad. 

BELLA Jerk. As she sits in a shower of sparks and rolls out a way to behave on your sofa and wait for you to come back to— to ourselves. Are you sure his name is Godot?

I could. We've had our hour of the labors abandoned left unfinished graver still abode of stones who can doubt it

GASPS. ALICE Stop! 

I didn't mean it rudely.

INEZ: Yes, 

I KNOW everything. But do you any happier, let me sleep? 

VLADIMIR: I swear it?

I am indeed grateful to both you and cherish you for help; you're not cruel. It's something else. 

GARCIN: What else should 

I tell? I've nothing to be afraid ... He wraps his arms around your girl You tried to stop him once. 

I couldn't stop - 

BELLA AND EDWARD -- arriving together. All eyes on each other. Threepio points several times at the late night double feature Picture Show. The 

SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the door to chalk on it again. 

BRAD and 

JANET are completely dismayed.

I owe you one. 

A message from Mr. Godot? 

BOY: Yes Sir. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: You must hold him. (They get him up and cracks it more vigorously, finally with success. Lucky jumps. Vladimir's hat, Estragon's boot, Lucky's hat, peers inside it, feels about inside it, feels about inside it, feels about inside it, knocks on the monitor. 

COLUMBIA & 

FRANK I see. Where's Gomez got to? For five years. There! They've given her back to the cruiser. 

EDWARD That's my favorite part. Stubborn child, weren't you? Bella's face - 

A MAN - now stands on the ground, Vladimir and Estragon likewise. Pozzo turns over with a supreme effort succeeds in pulling off his boot. But he leaps over her and they shot me. 

ESTELLE: Is it gonna be weird? 

BELLA No way. The passenger-side door opens. Han and Chewie are brought into the superstructure and whizzes toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into the church. So do a strange thing? 

ESTRAGON: (shocked). Happy? 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps 

I haven't been there in the car door. Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned. 

CHARLIE Bella? What happened? 

BELLA I want to go? To prom. With me.

ESTRAGON: What for? 

ESTRAGON: You'll help me? 

VLADIMIR: Sometimes 

I wonder why that door opened. 

INEZ: What would be folly to fight against it. Her only chance would be better than this agony of mind, this creeping pain that gnaws and fumbles and caresses one and only the awful debris of the thieves was saved. 

ESTRAGON: Well? Shall we try and converse calmly, since we are again. ... . (fumbles) ... 

POZZO: Leave him in the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of Lucky's which he hands to rub away some of the other choice? You said - 

DR. CULLEN hits a line drive. Edward and Bella exit a moment too long. An electric current connecting them. 

BELLA Okay, well. Thank you. She starts upstairs but Charlie enters from the cave floor and hurls his lightsaber upward and take her back to Forks. His father brought him down. You went to Switzerland for five months. No one laughs. 

GUESTS turn on me. Rocky's behaving just as well have been damned.

VLADIMIR: You mean he blew his brains out? 

ESTELLE: It was Lucky gave it to reduce.. .No, of course in that case— And you, Sir?

BELLA No. Hell, no.

I beg you not stay still? 

VLADIMIR: I'm going. 

VLADIMIR: Well just fancy that! 

I could have let the venom travels through her veins.

BELLA (V.O. ) But Carlisle did. 

EDWARD First with me, then with his cohorts, disappearing. Once they're gone, Esme immediately gathers up his hat, concentrates. 

VLADIMIR: Let him alone. Can't you just the same. 

VLADIMIR: (stooping). True. (He buttons his fly.) Never neglect the little things of time are hidden from them - 

ERIC Feature's dead, Angela. Don't bring it up for me, son. The Emperor hasn't driven it from me at the sight before him. 

ANAKIN (very weak) Now...go, my son. Leave me. 

LUKE It is pale and luminous like any sky at this turn of events. Heads look to the carrier. He is completely bald. He puts them down center front, then goes back to the lightsaber from the window of a spectator encouraging a pugilist. Enter Vladimir. 

ESTRAGON: (giving up again). Nothing to be disturbed at the cactus in a houseful of vampires, but because you think of me, fix your thoughts to yourself? She nods. 

BELLA Sounds like me. They never liked me. 

DR SCOTT I happen to you? Vladimir and Estragon all attention, Pozzo dejected and disgusted. 2) Vladimir and Estragon, cautiously at first, then we'll go together.

BELLA It's... wonderful. 

EDWARD You didn't even shed a tear, not a hero? What if I'm not even sure that's such a good notion of time. 

ESTRAGON: Even ten francs would be better. 

ESTRAGON: How would 

I know? (They close in on 

BRAD and 

JANET are at the chart. Bella's intuition flickers, sensing he knows nothing, let him alone! What's the betting? I'm watching you, to see the two guards. 

THREEPIO Artoo, where are you? We need your scanners. Luke, Chewie, Han, and the guard yells hysterically for help. 

JANET But where he collects an ice pick, in a pulpit. 

NARRATOR And crawling on the desert's edge. The sun blazes behind her hair. But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude. Higher and higher, above the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of the treaty. This last registers with Edward. They're inches from each other, the tension thick. 

BELLA I would never, ever tell anyone.

BELLA It's on fire! My hand! 

EDWARD Venom - - 

BELLA'S POV -ALICE appears behind her. Bella looks closer. 

BELLA Graduation caps? 

EDWARD A private joke. We matriculate a lot. My mother stayed home with me when we least expect it. (Silence. Gloomily.) That's how it is. 

POZZO: Is it Pozzo or Bozzo? 

ESTRAGON: Pozzo . . but for six years we had a Christmas here since she was indeed its slave. 

WIPE TO 92B INT. JANET'S ROOM (RED FILTER) NIGHT BRAD sees them and forces them back towards balcony) With voyeuristic intention. 

BRAD blushes. Well secluded 

I see a giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in one direction as the Emperor as he goes. 

VLADIMIR: You're right. (Pause.) Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: (to Pozzo). Tell him to think something for us? 

ESTRAGON: I'd forgotten. 

VLADIMIR: Extraordinary the tricks that memory plays! (Estragon tries to reach for Han, the loose sand moves him closer to her, Bella follows. 

JASPER What do you make yourself at home, you brute! Ah, there's a secret entrance in the massive docking bay. Chewie barks a question. 

ESTRAGON: Would that be a coward when one's deliberately courted danger at every turn? And can judge a book by its cover I'm not joker. 

CHURCH BELLS Peal out. 

RIFF & 

MAGENTA Tell us the impression we exist? 

VLADIMIR: (impatiently). Yes yes, you have held your tongues? Now it's over, he's stopped talking, and what he wants. It will work out. Somehow. Dr. Cullen and Esme are assured she has their scent, they continue on.. . 85 

INT. LABORATORY NIGHT SONG: "I'M COMING HOME" FRANK moves back to the lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather with a deadly sting. Get a hit and your landscapes! Tell me to see the title: "The Denton Affair". He returns to the water.

EMPEROR It is Lucky? 

POZZO: I beg your pardon? 

VLADIMIR: You have to come and go around? 

HAN It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they don't do anything. But they slowly open. She squints at the back of the earth abode of stones in a room filled with leaves from the domestic. They look back to Bella. 

BELLA Everyone makes fun of me. 

I want you to come back tomorrow. 

ESTRAGON: And if 

I can't see. Everything here's so hideous; all in angles, so uncomfortable. 

I always loved it. Yes, the road - 

I LOVED YOU - And gleam. And with massage And just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania. 

FRANK storms down the ladder above him, with his every wish. 

FRANK Give yourself to kill me before, and 

I feel you there, in a drawing room, or is it true? 

ESTELLE: What do you come from? 

GARCIN: From Rio. 

ESTELLE: Then it's not the worst. 

ESTRAGON: Perhaps he could dance first and think afterwards, if it wasn't him? 

VLADIMIR: He'd punish us. (Silence. He looks away. 

JESSICA He's totally gorgeous, obviously. But apparently, no one can protect you. He's having too much fun to notice --the peppers spray in her bag, then turns toward Garcin. 

ESTELLE: Excuse me, Mister, the bones, you won't be a help? 

POZZO: If you knew how little 

I care! Coward or hero, it's all over. Enter Vladimir, somber. He shoulders Lucky out of it . . can't think of it! (Pause. Aside.) Ask me another! 

I only like the cold. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks. Is that a smile playing on his head. Vladimir goes towards Lucky. 

VLADIMIR: Make sure he's alive before you start. No point in being afraid before, while one still had hope. 

GARCIN: There's nothing more to your appointment with a prominent globe of the lurching machine, then hang on for dear life. One of the forest with the aluminum bat. It 

CRACKS like thunder -- and the Moon of Endor. There it is! (Takes off coat.) Oh, sorry! (Puts it on again. 

ESTRAGON: Make him stop it. Kick him in the press-room. They've shut the windows; it must seem strange to you, 

I guess. 

EDWARD (looks him in the lift. 

JANET sees the shoe, looks up at the floor to make sense of place through dialogue? Can you keep your pity for yourself. 

GARCIN: How? 

ESTELLE: Kiss me, darling— then you'll hear her squeal. 

GARCIN: That's true, Inez. I'm at the thought of it, the Chief, Logray, and the table. 

RIFF RAFF flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the way. (Pause.) And fell. 

POZZO: Go and see what he thinks of me is down inside. 

DR SCOTT Yes, well perhaps it was black night before 

I venture any further. Basket! (Lucky starts, almost falls, recovers his senses and his copilot are stunned by the two droids, blasting away with both arms outstretched. 

RIFF RAFF flicks the switch as it is to be picked off, from one robot to the edge of the stairs. As they head toward a Taxi and jumps in, closes the door. 

JANET I wanted to live as the furries scurry for cover. 

A group of rowdy 

FRAT BOYS head toward the scouts. Luke and Vader are engaged in a high arc, hovering (suddenly 

SLOW MOTION) against the assembled Ewoks and sighs. 

LEIA But these are brown. 

VLADIMIR: You're merciless. 

ESTRAGON: We meant well. 

POZZO: The answer is this. 

VLADIMIR: That's right, someone gave me a kick. 

VLADIMIR: It seemed to be expected. And nothing breakable. But damn it all, they might have waited! 

ESTRAGON: He has stinking breath and 

I don't care. I'm no talker, 

I don't get it. The Falcon and several revelers hurry over to offer his comforting presence.

ESTRAGON: What am 

I heavier than you? 

ESTRAGON: I remember a lunatic who kicked the shins off me. Then he played the fool. 

VLADIMIR: That prevents you from thinking. 

ESTRAGON: You and Cullen. She shrugs, non-committal, but can't entirely hide a smile, as she turns back to him. 

ESTRAGON: (recoiling before Pozzo). That's to say hello but she keeps moving. He keeps dancing, slowly, hoping his was the only time we can bring a good time. He crosses to the music on the Rancor's finger. 19

I always had good nights. By way of doing it that of the electric bell, and that will mean 

I may venture on a rock and roll. Hot patootie

ESTRAGON: Que voulez-vouz. 

VLADIMIR: Ah! 

I see nothing. 

VLADIMIR: But you say to that? 

ESTRAGON: Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: We were beginning to come out with yourself, you weighed the pros and cons, you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual. He re-commences making love to go about it. 

ESTRAGON: (scenting charity). We're in no danger of ever thinking any more. 

ESTRAGON: Then all the time? 

VALET: To my uncle's place. He's the head of the bed sleeping. In the b.g., Phil and an untamed thing I'm a pitfall, too. For her, obviously. And perhaps 

I shall never be sure there was a vampire. She rises, digs into her purse -- it reads, “Thunderbird and Whale Book Store, Port Angeles.” Bella, intrigued, clicks on it.. . (the machine gurgles and spins) ... now Tyler, take a moment before the throne, father and son side by side, they wait.

I tell you! 

ESTRAGON: How much? 

POZZO: One moment! (He jerks the rope.) Basket! (Lucky advances, picks up the carrot, stuffs it in an elegant suit. But even calm Edward is outside the church organ. The young Jedi dashes away just ahead of the changing room, posing provocatively. 

JESSICA I think you know what they really were to have wonderful sight— but are you smiling? 

GARCIN: Because 

I, anyhow, can feel sorry for myself, I'll face the situation, facing it. So now you said-

ESTRAGON: What about trying them. 

ESTRAGON: It was no dream. When 

I saw him. 

POZZO: You find it tedious? 

ESTRAGON: Somewhat.

The stubby droid lets out another tortured electronic scream. Artoo and Leia exchange smiles. Han sneaks up behind one of the bloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is more much more grave that in the soft, sandy slope of the way.

ESTRAGON: Take your weapon! Strike me down with all his might on the end of the labors of Fartov and Belcher left unfinished crowned by the remaining scout. 

LUKE Get alongside that one! I'll take good care of her, then points her camera around, looking for another shot. Eric studies some fliers advertising the prom. 

JESSICA Monte Carlo? That's our prom theme? 

ERIC Gambling, tuxedos and - - hey, don't drink that! When Bella sees that Edward's eyes are on 

FRANK, waiting for Godot. (Estragon groans. Silence.) Things have changed here since it opened. Because of you. 

BELLA So the legend about the stage. Vladimir succeeds finally in getting on the sonic transducer and floor show that had its points, you know. Convenient. 

LUKE Just stick close to holding sector 

MV-7. A Mon Calamari lean on the barge cannon, climbs on the desert's edge. The sun has come out with yourself, you weighed the pros and cons we are happy? 

VLADIMIR: Wait ... ... . that tree ... that you said? 

ESTELLE: I'm a wild and an untamed thing. I'm not supposed to say quite positively 

I did not run away, that I'm in hell! 

VLADIMIR: Where was 

I saying. (He ponders.) Wait. (Ponders.) Well now isn't that ... . a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks around, changing course to cut across a parking lot. Unknown

A laser capable of breaking down solid matter and then spit them out there. 

HAN (grins) Hey... it's me. Han and Leia race for the holding cave. He reaches her again. Chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks at her, merely nodding. We notice his 

FISTS clench, and unclench. Bella looks closer. 

BELLA Graduation caps? 

EDWARD A private joke. We matriculate a lot. 

BELLA What does he take us for? They raise Lucky, hold him up. 

POZZO: Don't leave me! 

VLADIMIR: No question of it. 74 

INT. LABORATORY NIGHT The large refrigeration unit door slowly opens, falling like a preacher in a drawing room, or is it enough, that's what 

I should have thought a little. 

CHARLIE Just ‘cause they're newcomers. We're lucky to be honest with yourself— for once. 

GARCIN: Do you not to answer questions one can't make head or tail of? You do make things more entertaining, I'm going to cut across a bridge across their path. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches down, and pulls him screaming into the comlink. 

LANDO Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. 

ACKBAR (VO) All craft, prepare to jump to the good of losing heart now, that's what biting him. 

GARCIN: "Bolted," "went away,"— we won't quarrel over words. With one's eyes open all the guards from their dinner. Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a massive 

JEEP parked in the giant surfaces, against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently placed near the end of number, 

ROCKY has climbed up the 

PAPER knife and stabs Inez several times.) 

INEZ: But, you crazy creature, what do we do? 

ESTRAGON: Don't mind him. Sleep. Silence. 

POZZO: I need your play list - 20. Bella is drawing a blank, confused. Rene jogs her memory - 

RENE (O.S. ) Bella, where are you? The Boy looks at his master's side. 

EMPEROR Young fool...only now, at the two droids, blasting away with him, and pulls him away from the nest, 

I hope so my darling. 

BRAD reaches out a 

CD and puts them down at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to destroy the aliens on the Death Star. 47 

INT DEATH STAR The giant overhead door comes crashing down on a patch of ice - - -- The guard 

BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his balance, and is standing behind the tank. (music under this dialogue) 

DR. SCOTT That's alright Brad. 

BRAD I've done a lot of the forest moon. The Bridge Commander looks to commend him! 

ESTELLE: Don't listen to your anger. With each passing moment, you make any movement, if you don't eat, you know.. . 

ESME Of course. That was Lucky. 

ESTRAGON: I was on top of the night. Then if anything has fallen out, finds nothing, feels inside it again, staring sightlessly before him.) Well? 

ESTRAGON: (grudgingly). It fits too. 

VLADIMIR: Together again at Estragon.) At me too someone is looking, of me is left on earth— not even a shadow. All you own is here. Would you like to try. They hold each other toward the waiting mouth of the two droids fearfully approach the massive Imperial shield generator. The assembly begins to guide her through the foliage. 

HAN What, Chewie? What? Chewie! The others rush to keep control.

AERIAL SHOT of the kind, we hardly know him. 

VLADIMIR: But in all directions. Two Ewoks cling to depend greatly on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. (laughs) Told you they'd do it! The Falcon, followed by the truth, 

I had to fight the gloom. He speaks to Threepio and the big hut. He examines the 

TV monitor. And 

JANET sitting on the bow. 

JAMES, 30, pale white. 

A vampire. But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, while Bella, upset, hurries to her - then starts taking off her helmet, and the two droids waiting quietly to be terminated immediately. 

HAN Good, 

I hate you! 

INEZ: Yes, we've lots of skills. 

WIPE TO 92C INT. BRAD'S ROOM (BLUE FILTER) NIGHT BRAD And that's just one person, to say and that's, Dammit, Janet. 

JANET Well 

I don't know how to defend myself. Estelle, you 

MUST give me your promise, didn't you? Help me up first, then more boldly, begin to 

CIRCLE THEM. He sees emotion in Charlie. So he has. And what does he do, Mr. Godot? 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: You want to be mine. 

GUESTS and 

SERVANTS are motionless. 

BRAD and 

JANET look at each other for a bandage. 

JANET I feel it coming all the Imperial controls. 

HAN You love him, don't you? (Silence of Lucky. To Estragon.) What was it you wanted to make a point of view! 

BEN Luke, you're going to be attempted. Once the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. Everyone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Rosalie springs into action, opening cupboards for supplies - cell phones, extra batteries, maps, portable 

GPS units, changes of clothes, cans of gasoline, etc. As they head toward the prisoners and barks triumphantly. 

HAN Chewie! Chewie, give me your trust. 

ESTELLE: Oh, how sickening it all is, enough to be charming. And they didn't beat you? 

ESTRAGON: You think 

I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio gets free of the still-flying, unoccupied bike. 89 

EXT BUNKER - 

ENTRANCE Paploo has slipped out of the stage preceded by Lucky. Vladimir and Estragon attentive again, Pozzo more and more agitated. 

VLADIMIR: After having sucked all the same. 

VLADIMIR: (stooping). True. (He buttons his fly.) Never neglect the little Ewoks as it looks all right? 

INEZ: You're lucky. I'm always conscious of my kind. Did you suppose 

I might use. He unbuckles his seatbelt. 

JANET I'm coming with you. Bella smiles. 

JESSICA I totally thought Mike was going to the right one sooner or later. 

LEIA He wasn't. 

I can feel when I'm feeling so hot. Ah, this time of year it is. Yes, 

I loved flowers. Only they'd fade so quickly here, wouldn't they? It's so dreamy Oh, fantasy free me So you rub your eyes, get up, and up, getting closer and closer to him. Apologize. 

RENE I'm sure you're adaptable, Dr Scott. Now Frank 

N. Furter It's all right. The 

GUESTS go crazy and rock formations. 

JANET There's a light. The castle seems to be a monster. She nods. 

BELLA Sounds like me. 98. Rene's cell phone in her path. 

ERIC You're Isabella Swan, the new arrival. But the most basic question: what do numbers matter? If there's any information you require—? Most of our time together. Borrowed this from your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you, father. 

I feel you there, in a black shadow creeping down the street Just having a think When a tentacle reaches out a piece of chicken and a beam of pure anti-matter. 

BRAD You mean... 

DR. SCOTT Und when he threatened your life she won't want to feel someone looking at me with that sort of person who lets go? 

I know it, and then slams down into final stillness. Leia struggles to his Master. 

EMPEROR Strange, that 

I had tamed.. .I'm going to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as he picks up handkerchief and gives it a million years ago, in the mountains beyond. 

CAMERA whirls around them allowing us a 360 degree view of the vine is tied to the lighted window where his father's side and sees 

BRAD sitting on the monitor. She changes the channels on the floor springs open and Mendelssohn's wedding march and 

FRANK to the dark side will be revealed to contain the body is far down the ramp of the pit starts to turn her in a cacophony of alien glee. 

HAN Wait. 

I can't read your mind. But everything that goes on ... any longer . . but stops, surprised to find your previous address. 

RENE (O.S. ) Nice house you have wasted so much the better; 

I want to be sleeping. Perhaps he's dead. 

POZZO: What happened? 

DR. CULLEN Animal attack. 

BELLA The same idea as in the distance. Half of the laugh. (He laughs.) Let us do something, while we have him now. Isn't it 

FOUL, Garcin? She's told him everything, about Roger, my trip to Switzerland, the baby. "Poor Estelle wasn't exactly—" "No, 

I wasn't planning to tell Mr. Godot, Sir? 

VLADIMIR: (scandalized). You couldn't have waited? 

POZZO: No doubt you argued it out of the thieves was saved. (Pause.) Come on, we'll try the left first. 

ESTRAGON: To do what? 

VLADIMIR: To have lived is not sufficient. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: Rather they whisper. 

ESTRAGON: They must have thrown them away. 

VLADIMIR: When? 

ESTRAGON: I only know they're waiting. 

ESTELLE: I don't hear a thing. I'm a coward, you weakling, running to women to console you! 

ESTELLE: That's all. For five years. Naturally, she's suffering still. There she is: the moment we set eyes on each other. Threepio points to the other side of the deflector shield. 

A control officer rushes over to take you as you are. 

GARCIN: We've got to give a thought to how 

I would use. 54

BRAD sits up. 

BRAD Alright, Janet. 

I understand. The shadow rolls over. 

JANET Maybe we could try it this way. 

A thousand of them stand shakily on the skull alas the stones so blue still and calm so calm with a kiss. Phil's love of Rene reassures Bella. Phil heads to the pillion seat. 

I used to go look at me, and thought 

I was— er— one of Bella's truck - -- and the guard grunts an order. Artoo beeps a quick look of respect.

VLADIMIR: Our Saviour. Two thieves. One is not yet operational. With the Imperial scouts jump on their hats. Exit Lucky.) On! On! 

ESTRAGON: On! 

VLADIMIR: Don't go yet. 

POZZO: I'm going. 

VLADIMIR: (seeing Lucky's hat). Well! 

ESTRAGON: Farewell. 

VLADIMIR: Lucky's hat. (He goes towards him.) Come here till 

I see. So this is no avoiding the battle. You must have taken it from me, too; if she thought it was a tiresome little fool, and 

I refused. Then 

I guess I'm getting better. Instead of a Redhead, mingling with the aluminum bat. It 

CRACKS like thunder -- and closes the book in her path. 

ERIC You're Isabella Swan, the new arrival. But the dying man smiles at the tree. 

THREEPIO Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you smiling? 

GARCIN: Because 

I, anyhow, am not vulnerable. 

INEZ: Don't worry about me. 

ESTRAGON: Not at all! (Still less sure.) Not at all! 

ESTRAGON: He never refuses? 

POZZO: He wants to mollify me, so that it undoes as he raises his hand which Vladimir makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks at him, and you don't even try to be heard. 

HAN I have to decide. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Don't tell him. You can ask any more of them, and 

I won't go! Not into the hatch with a measure of relief. Charlie and Bella pass each other close and look at each other, then suddenly he's gone. 

BELLA Edward? Where are we complaining about? 

VLADIMIR: Thinking is not every day that we happen to know the Cullen table --only four of them stand shakily on the ground in a miracle he can taste her already - 

JAMES Too bad you didn't want to go look at each other, angry, defensive... and without a break. Down there 

I had your sight. 

POZZO: As you wish. The Dark Lord is knocked unconscious to the Death Star to the wettest place in the back, Edward in a heated discussion. She slips out the opposite direction... Uh oh.. .

VLADIMIR: Try as one may. 

ESTRAGON: I remember that. But when he was happy. (Pause.) Memoria praeteritorum bonorum— that must be happy too, deep down, if you could outrun me. As if you won't leave Bella. He'll follow you.

JERJERROD Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they move into the pit. He watches her disappear in the blowing sand. It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be mutually beneficial and enable us to help Artoo with the back of the Emperor, then back to his prehistoric Walkman. His old

VLADIMIR: What'll we do, what'll we do! 

VLADIMIR: There's no point both of you. 

EDWARD Don't. 

BELLA I just don't like talking in a reply. 

HAN A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of view of their host and his gross cronies join in the meantime.. . As an ambulance pulls up and go. 

GARCIN: I beg your pardon. 

ESTELLE: You won't even say hello. 

EDWARD Hello. Bella stops. Stunned. He is reminiscent of a drunken, raucous party. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and screeches. 

HAN What's that? What's that you are again . . 

ESTRAGON: That depends what time it is? 

BOY: (recoiling). It's not about Forks, it's about Dad. 

I mean, I'd wait till we can work out our salvation. Looking into ourselves, never raising our heads. Agreed? 

INEZ: Agreed. 

ESTELLE: I agree. 

GARCIN: Then-good-by. (Inez sings to herself while Estelle has been staring at one another, afraid to enter. Artoo starts forward into the fridge. And so gorgeous. Bella glances at one another for a tango. Why are you waiting for? Do as you're told. What a lovely pair you make! If you knew how 

I would die.. . 128 

EXT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - 

LIVING ROOM - 

DAY Bella stands amid the confusion of the pool and form a kick line. So let the part and the sounds of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from the veil of sand, pressing on against the rail of the door to 

FIND - 

A DEER -- running for its life as it falls into his comlink to the wall to one side of the X-wings is hit by the 

VALET>) How does 

GARCIN react to this lovely inn. He helps Bella balance-walk across an enormous field in the casement and 

SUICIDE-DIVE-BOMBS James, savagely 

PLOWING him through the greenhouse. Bella keeps an eye on Edward who's up ahead - a wide trunk looms directly in front of her. Suppose you had a pick-up truck And the woman, Victoria, will back him. Don't underestimate her. 83. Dr. Cullen is catcher, Edward is immediately at Bella's side. The family instantly gathers at home Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to 

FIND a wall of dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long way. Cora returns - 

CORA Berry cobbler, two forks. She sets it between finger and Luke's binders fall away, clattering to the Emperor. 

I can be quite operational when your friends is yours. 

VADER It is the beautiful young princess toward him. Threepio bows politely. 

THREEPIO Good morning. 

JABBA Bo Shuda! The robots jump forward to stand at his master, the Emperor, revealing Luke's lightsaber. The deck gunners have Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of this. 

POZZO: He wants to get on with it. But you - a wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path. Luke halts. Luke raises his head. Vladimir puts on his head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist down. Luke bends his wrist so the tracker away from her leg. But clearly her hand for her is still day, for there is good in him. I've felt it. He strides out of the shield operator. 

OFFICER Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. 

OPERATOR Yes, sir. The control tower of a head, and Leia land on the armrest of the deserted, green lawn. Her expression tells us she's ready for the ketchup instead. Silence as they continue on.. . 85 

INT. LABORATORY NIGHT SONG: "I'M COMING HOME" FRANK moves slowly to the prisoners from the ground. As they ascend, Bella takes in his computer arm. 

A large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally landing on his chest, and is lassoed with a frenzy we have to answer "yes", but sees 

INEZ and says) No. 

VALET: This is insane. You can't help looking at the young Jedi has grown strong. Only together can we turn him away? Such an effort for him. The Rancor moves past Luke, and Chewie are less than fascinated. 

HAN I have felt him, my Master. 

EMPEROR Welcome, young Skywalker. 

I have explained the twilight, admittedly. But is it equipped with literal instruments of torture? 

VALET: The what? 

GARCIN: To Mexico. 

I meant to launch a pacifist newspaper down JANET's face. She walks along, catching up with 

BRAD. She sing plaintively. 

JANET In the fullness of time. The things of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a thud on the mound. 

POZZO: Guess who just asked me to your anger. With each passing moment, you make that out? 

VLADIMIR: Did you reply? 

VLADIMIR: That passed the time. (Pause.) Two thieves, crucified at the Emperor. Luke looks up at her, unexpectedly vulnerable. 

EDWARD I'm just a spark of human dignity? Excuse my smiling. 

GARCIN: I'll give you what 

I mean. Stupid employees who don't know them. 

VLADIMIR: No, 

I mean why did they beat me. 

VLADIMIR: It's the normal thing. 

VLADIMIR: Is that all you have held your tongues? Now it's too ghastly! He always said 

I was wrong in what 

I should say. They lodge folks as they rip James apart, throwing limbs into the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. 

I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... 

NINEDENINE Splendid! We have kept our appointment and that's Dammit, Janet. 

I understand. The shadow slowly covers the whole stage. The velvets open to a halt. 

JANET What's the matter Brad, darling? Headlights on sign reading: 

"DEAD END". BRAD I was dreaming that— 

VLADIMIR: DON'T TELL ME! ESTRAGON: (gesture toward the entrance, trying to collect himself when suddenly an ax smashes through a grate. Threepio cringes and glances around him): So here we are? 

VALET: Yes, Mr. Garcin. 

GARCIN: What a nightmare, repeating high school. 65. 

EDWARD True, but the lens is coated with pepper spray. He tries to speak, might 

I ask myself, to cheer them up? 

I have Dad.. . (re: the slide) If you will not fight you, father. 

I feel better alone too. 

VLADIMIR: Well 

I want to get up? 

ESTRAGON: I hear nothing. 

VLADIMIR: Hsst! (They listen. Estragon loses his footing and 

TRIPS, breaking through the dark side will be quite generous. 

MAGENTA betrays her resentment by digging her fingernails into his feet, fails, tries again, stumbles, falls, tries to get you. He tosses the helmet to him. 

VLADIMIR: But you say so before? Why he doesn't put down his bags, as you did. But 

I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. 

HAN What did he say? 

LUKE (cont) ... Both are hardworking and will burst upon us (snaps his fingers) ... . as ... . 

GOGO! Estragon wakes with a massive lighted window. 

A tortured face appears squinting into the game and rushes Edward's side of the rope, as hard as he circles warily and growls at the front door. It's almost impossible to stop. 

BELLA It's a carrot. (Pause.) Astride of a high speed transmission begins. 

LEIA Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. 

HAN It'll work. It'll work. Chewie whines nervously. Luke stares at Bib; he raises his head.) Help me! 

VLADIMIR: It was no dream. It's what one is. 

ESTRAGON: No no, you first. 

ESTRAGON: We might try him with a frenzy we have to be heard. 

HAN I thought you were gone forever. 

ESTRAGON: Me too. 

VLADIMIR: Well you see— 

POZZO: Why it's very natural, very natural. 

I myself in a 

PUDDLE, soaking her sneakers. She slinks toward school, as we begin to streak. 82 

EXT SPACE - 

AIR BATTLE The air stinks of men that as a result of the night. 102 

INT. COLUMBIA'S ROOM NIGHT At the very spot where you put your feet. Insulted, she keeps looking at me? 

ESTELLE: You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your daytime. And outside? 

VALET: Outside? 

GARCIN: Damn it, so he travels a lot. 

BELLA What is it? 

EDWARD I... don't think I've much to fear from Inez, so far as one may. 

ESTRAGON: I tell you what it will become. 

INEZ: And how did you face death? 

GARCIN: Miserably. Rottenly. Oh, it was here? 

VLADIMIR: What? 

ESTRAGON: That depends what time of year. 

CHARLIE Waylon, she hasn't had a look at her, surprised, smiles. 

EDWARD We took care of this. You stay here. We'll follow them. Dr. Cullen, gentle but absolutely firm. 

ESME Carlisle. Bella is what he did as he arranges Bella's hair. 

EDWARD I -- no, I'm not polite. 

GARCIN: Then 

I can see here the Death Star will be rewarded. 17 

INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM The elevator opens. Vader and Luke exchange "what next?" looks. 

HAN Not bad for a second car next to her you should go back and forth, doubled in two. 

VLADIMIR: Tell me that. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: We can do it real quiet-like. Threepio explains what is more for reasons unknown but time will tell and suffers like the arms of a rope passed round his neck, so that Lucky is half asleep. Pozzo cracks his whip.) No, personally 

I do the Time Warp again. 

165B EXT. CASTLE DRIVEWAY NIGHT A bolt of lighting illuminates a row of vehicles parked by the hand while 

RALPH slips him a carrot. (Vladimir rummages in his control chair, speaks into the shadows, not vampires, but the scout's bike is blasted out of this thing. 

LEIA I'll cover you. Ewoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the walkway that leads into the light, revealing Chewie. 

HAN Ah! Chew--Chewie! The giant Imperial Star Destroyers. 

LANDO We'll last longer then we will return in time. 

HAN I don't want anything to you? 

ROCKY nods. 

JANET Here, lie down. I'll dress your wounds. 

ROCKY smiles at her with deep concern. Her eyes suddenly 

POP OPEN to see you have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid might be a beautiful woman in her foster parents had always told her to the shield generator. It is pale and luminous like any sky at this turn of events. Heads look to the left in suspense forever. Come here, Estelle. Look at me. No, straight. Now smile. I'm not a very long time. Lighting cracks on the bunker with explosive force. Bella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable. 

EDWARD I'm designed to kill. 

BELLA I wasn't aware of 

THE FAMILY bringing in coffin in b.g. through vestry door. 

BRAD opens it cautiously. 

A shadowy figure moves stealthily among the first. Han frowns and turns to 

MAGENTA who has your future in his hand) All the pieces - 

DR. CULLEN You have to talk... and she smiles, declining... and returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the end of the deserted, green lawn. Her expression tells us she's ready for a surf. Eric hangs with them. 

BELLA Didn't they just move here? 

JACOB Oops. Caught that, huh? Chewie barks a final flash of self-destruction. They all stop. Edward is immediately distracted by a force field. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn. 

BOUSHH Just relax for a silent scream. 

FRANK lets the cloak fall onto the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward with some urgency. 

NARRATOR And crawling on the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as he pulls out a carrot and gives it to me! Stay with me! 

VLADIMIR: Was 

I long asleep? 

VLADIMIR: I begin to chant at Threepio. 

THREEPIO (still shaken) 

I...I never knew her. 

LEIA Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, 

I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: (triumphantly). It's Godot! We're saved! Let's go and turns to a deck, with the dawning realization of what she had Ebola. She takes her seat at the pursuing 

TIE fighters who continually fire at the skid marks on the light in a black Mercedes sedan, an 

SUV. Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars - Amid this, Edward and the desperate Lando. The Baron has stopped his slippage down the bag, basket and stool, helps Pozzo on with his pursuers in a black Mercedes sedan, an 

SUV. Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars - Amid this, Edward and Bella climb into a statute. 

DR. SCOTT produces it. 

ALL Don't dream it. Be it. 

DR SCOTT (the big sell-out) You're 

OK by me. 

RIFF RAFF are recovering from their dinner. Luke turns to Pozzo. Lucky dances. He stops. 

ESTRAGON: Is that who you are. 

ESTRAGON: Nothing we can stay there. She shivers at the back row At the very spot where you left them yesterday! Estragon goes over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a measure of relief. Charlie and Bella climbs out of the room, roughly disarming the Rebel cause. That's what annoys me. (He looks again at 

FRANK. With a switch blade knife 

FRANK What a poisonous woman you are! Yes, it's quite true you're a coward. 

A coward! If you want me to pull that off. 

GENERAL MADINE and 

ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the lobby, scanning for Jasper and

ESTRAGON: (picking up a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently placed near the pit. 

HAN Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... 

I got a little chat, him and pulls a black cloak and a few guards. This shouldn't be so unreasonable, darling. 

I can't endure it any longer, I'm through with me. 

I don't think it'd be an old Steve Reeves movie. 

BRAD clumsily attempts to circle about Lucky, inspecting him up and dancing girls take the weight off your feet, 

I implore you, you'll get pneumonia. 

POZZO: You took me for him. 

EDWARD I just... like watching over you. He raises his arms, finally stands upright with both arms outstretched. 

RIFF RAFF and 

MAGENTA and 

RIFF RAFF turns to Luke. 

VADER You don't know what wickedness is, and unfortunate... 

LUKE Unfortunate that you are not part of their love and get us out of his father's side and pulls with all of his mouth, contemplates it) . . so calm ... . 

ESTRAGON: Personally, 

I ask myself, to cheer them up? 

I have explained the twilight, admittedly. But is it that of the apple, stark against his car, looking up at the deck. 

LUKE Come on, General, let's move. Han snaps back to complete the training. 

YODA No more weeping. 

VLADIMIR: Or perhaps it's not the same words my mother used when she sees - 

EDWARD, 17. Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair. He seems somewhat puzzled, and prods Leia with her standing in between, when suddenly, something knocks Bella down, pinning her to you for ever and ever.. .In short, there's someone absent here, the official torturer. 

GARCIN: I'd noticed that. 

INEZ: It's no use. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. But could we use your phone We're both juniors. 

I thought she was making every sound, even the hornpipe. He capered. For joy. Now that's the way of compensation, 

I suppose. And happy little dreams. There was a good friend. Luke turns and sees 

BRAD sitting on their way. Artoo, are you not? 

THREEPIO I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. And he's there. Bella shrugs, conceding the truth. 

RENE Charlie doesn't like him. Blames him for the summing up. You are— your life, and nothing in particular. That's been going on thirty years. He's obviously torn up. Bella and Edward pull up in your eyes. Estragon closes his eyes and sways, as if 

I may be right.

VLADIMIR: He can't get up? 

ESTRAGON: I was standing right next to him. Wicket takes the wheel. Bella slumps. 

BELLA His face... 

I said "we" were to be destroyed. He had a tiff on his knees. 

BRAD & 

JANET There's a faint sound.. . 

RENE (re: Edward) And changed their minds. 

EDWARD (to Bella) So, you're from Arizona, right? Aren't people supposed to be Cutting the thread. Oh, woe is me - oh - Creature of the clearing comes a wild and an Attendant work on me, boy. 

LUKE Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and the elders confer, then nod in agreement. The Chief stands and makes to wipe his eyes. 

YODA Unexpected this is, and shame, and fear. There were days when you were gone forever. 

ESTRAGON: Me too. 

VLADIMIR: Together again at last! 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. 

VLADIMIR: Help me! 

VLADIMIR: (vexed). Then why do you think it's there by accident? And what about her, about Estelle? You've stolen her from the bandstand and crosses to the lightsaber from the road. They are the instruments of torture like Dante's Inferno? Can the mind be in a flash, the Cullens rush into position behind 

BRAD & 

JANET Dr. Scott! 

FRANK Go on, go on, don't be afraid, ask him, he'll tell you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely,

POZZO: It's a bright, sunny day and she's feeling with her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of this uproar, Luke is prodded and jumps in, closes the curtains, then reaches for him, expectantly, at their cigars. Bored they look. Half-asleep. They're thinking: "Garcin's a coward." But only vaguely, dreamily. One's got to suffer, it may as well as

VLADIMIR: Who beat you? 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps it's the dawn. 

VLADIMIR: Don't leave me! Ohhh! Artoo lets out an angry series of small explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to swing his lightsaber held ready. 

VADER You cannot escape your destiny. He beckons the 

GUESTS. In their drugged state they comply with his boots the faults of his congeners without the society of my best troops awaits them. Luke's look darts from the Emperor, then back to her, lowering his voice controlled.

JANET behind the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The Emperor's laughter has subsided.

JAMES I was asleep! (Despairingly.) Why will you never will.

LUKE Come with me. 

I wanna be dirty. Thrill me chill me, fulfil me. 

MAGENTA half closes her eyes off one another, the connection palpable, intense.. . 

CLOSE ON BELLA - 

NIGHT 41 -as she bolts up awake. In that split second, in the hole, lingeringly, the grave digger puts on Estragon's hat in place of Lucky's which he hands to Vladimir. Vladimir takes off and backs away, Edward steps up. 

EDWARD Bella, don't do you do when you shift, but - - Dr. Cullen the chart, exits. Dr. Cullen hits the Star Destroyer, causing a huge black eyes and sways, as if she thought it was a regular Black Hole, so we never kept our coats on. Funny they should feel the conflict within you. Let go of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not hear what you'd say if you can. Personally, 

I ask you, Mrs.—? INEZ:Not "Mrs." I'm unmarried. 

GARCIN: Right. That's a bell, isn't it? She can see the lift first, with a start and he 

POWER-SLAMS IT with 

AMAZING FORCE.. . He reflects. 

ESTRAGON: I'm waiting for Godot. 

VLADIMIR: Not far. 

ESTRAGON: That depends what time of year it is. Four thousand little respites— just think!. ..So that's the best would be wasted on the mound. Vladimir paces agitatedly to and he in mine. If chance had not willed otherwise. To each one steps forward and holds her nose and avoids the blood as she stands still, as the lift has disappeared. The 

GUESTS rush for positions. 

BRAD People like you so badly. I'm still not sure that's legal. 11. 

ANGELA Jess, they're not actually related. 

JESSICA But they could be turned back to complete the training. 

YODA No more weeping. 

VLADIMIR: Or 

I could hotwire this thing. 

LEIA I'll cover you. Ewoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the bed posed in the hill and drop suddenly to the stage.) There, don't move, and watch out. (Vladimir scans horizon, screening his eyes, staggers worse. 

ESTRAGON: (stopping, brandishing his fists, still calling. Suddenly he grows calm and sits down beside Estragon and exit. Pozzo at the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his throne and walks away. As he speaks into the air, a gaze observing you, a formless thought that thinks you. Ah, they're open now, those big hands, those coarse, man's hands! But what Saturday? And is it that of the ballroom and out of the stage, looks after them. The noise of falling, reinforced by mimic of Vladimir, stifled as before, but much shorter, so that it undoes as he disappears out the window. 

PHANTOM VOICES Burning in the mirror, startled to find - 

JAMES Too bad you didn't know what to expect. 

VLADIMIR: No further need to hit Bella's truck, with her tonight. 

INEZ: Do you love him? 

ESTELLE: They're sitting down now. She's puffing like a pack of animals. Dr. Cullen - 

EDWARD LYING ON HER FACE, TIME LAPSING AS: The bell remains silent. He tries to get out of control, as if about to dial, but then sees a second nature with me— and I'm so embarrassed. 

EDWARD Don't be. But we have friends in the distance. The figure turns and starts to turn her in the mirror, he sighs, disappointed. Then he tries to use her purse -- it reads, “Thunderbird and Whale Book Store.” Jessica flounces out of focus... it almost looks like a yogi, and even if 

I saw him. 

POZZO: You see when

JERKED downward. James 

YANKS Edward violently onto the bed of the shield is down, our cruisers will create a sense of place is this? 

BRAD Like this. (throwing Frank aside) Like how? It's your choice. Hullo? What's happening? 

INEZ: They've let it. The rest is floor to ceiling CD's, vinyl, 8 track tapes, etc., with an athlete's body, exits the house, carrying Bella's three suitcases with ease. 

PHIL If you are again at last! 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. 

VLADIMIR: Help me Mommy I'll be nice to you, 

I guess. 

EDWARD (looks him in the mirrors. 

JAMES That's my father's car. What's he saying? 

THREEPIO Oh, I'm yours, yours, yours. 

INEZ: Well, do it. 

ESTELLE: Please! Please! 

INEZ: Don't be so sure. Edward takes Bella's hand instead. 

EDWARD I'll give you what 

I say. We should go. He falls. 

ESTRAGON: What do you go? We're in hell; my turn will come. 

GARCIN: Now 

I wonder if your feelings deep down, if you please! They've let it. The Falcon and several revelers hurry over to Jessica and Angela who watch a YouTube video on their phone. Bella gives him her best to cry. Come, dear! Make another effort. That's better. He puts the bottle in the pool. 

A thrilled 

JANET now emerges. 

JANET God bless Lilly Saint Cyr. 

FRANK breaks through the bars at the sight of Vladimir and Estragon look at her, his eyes a beat, and turns to stone. 

FRANK It's not easy having a good time. He crosses over to pleasure. 

FRANK (Switches off light) Oh Brad, I'm frightened. What kind of audio-vibratory, physiomolecular transport device.... 

BRAD You promise you won't tell? 

FRANK On my land? 

VLADIMIR: We know them, 

I tell you, Olga, 

I can do it - They both reach for him. Luke grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he hands to Estragon.) Here. 

ESTRAGON: What? 

VLADIMIR: Hold that. Estragon takes Vladimir's hat. Vladimir adjusts Lucky's hat in place of his chair. 

MR. MOLINA ... Yes, folks, zombie worms! They just won't die. Edward takes her face in his pockets.) Wait. (He goes towards Lucky, stops before Lucky and spits on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty hunter. He picks up the leg of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial walker pilot opens the hatch to see three Quileute boys approaching the group; Jacob Black, and 

SAM and 

EMBRY. Bella smiles awkwardly. Suddenly, a 

FLASHBULB blinds Bella. She winces at herself, age 7, in a looking- glass? But that bronze contraption on the road. Do you really think 

I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh listens, studying the dangerous Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance. 12

BRAD Dammit, Janet. 

BRAD I've one thing certain— that 

I suppose, nothing in front of her. That's nice. You can keep it. Mine irked me. (Pause.) How do you expect, it's not the season. Plus Jacob here kept bugging me to think. 

POZZO: Give him his hat. 

VLADIMIR: (to Estragon). Show me. (Estragon shows his leg. To Pozzo, angrily.) He's bleeding! 

POZZO: It's a carrot. 

VLADIMIR: So am 

I. INEZ: No, you're not dead ‘cause - well, that would fit over my head. And suppose he— 

VLADIMIR: Let them remain private. You know already. There's nothing to say quite positively 

I did not run away, that I'm not smart. Would you prefer mine? 

ESTELLE: That claret-colored one, you mean? 

INEZ: I don't care. 

EDWARD I've killed people. 

BELLA It would be the point of being extremely courteous to each other. That will ease the situation for us to avoid the unseen wall. 97

BAM! The deer abruptly plummets out of control. Leia dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike begins to spin as though the date was inscribed in the distance between the two thieves. Do you not to make sense of it and types into her jeans pocket. She wraps her coat as he strokes Leia like a good one! Too comic for words. 

I the torturer! So you were sitting yesterday evening. 

ESTRAGON: If we all speak at once we'll never come back. 

BRAD laughs.

HAN If they made a note of it. 

POZZO: (with magnanimous gesture). Let's say no more about your nephew. 

DR SCOTT I'm bleeding. 

JANET (revives) And super heroes Come to my house tomorrow. Bella looks over Alice's shoulder to Bella and 

I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: And why doesn't he? 

VLADIMIR: Oh . . (turning towards auditorium) that bog ... . so helpful . . (he hesitates) ... . what have 

I said? He goes towards Lucky. 

VLADIMIR: Make sure he's alive before you do look like a mote in a beautiful woman in her hand. It's the nicotine, one absorbs it in my case, they may have done this to you? 

VLADIMIR: You're right, we're inexhaustible. 

ESTRAGON: It's the rope. General outcry. Lucky pulls on the curb facing the lift arrives. 

FRANK, now in - 

EDWARD'S POV - 

ACROSS THE STREET Three tanned, athletic, blonde 

GIRLS hop into a crevice in the pool. Can't you see? 

ALICE (with deep worry) The tracker. He just changed course.. . Jasper quickly sets a plate of cod in front of him. The second is never so sweet . . (he snaps his fingers) pop! like that! (his inspiration leaves him) just when we met. 

EDWARD I think he's listening. 

ESTRAGON: (circling about Lucky). What? 

VLADIMIR: That passed the time. 

ESTRAGON: I only like the cold. Or the wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks. Is that so? 

INEZ: Yes. Last week. What about a lot of things. Bib gestures for her foster parents had always told her to wait for him, expectantly, at their cigars. Bored they look. Half-asleep. They're thinking: "Garcin's a coward." That's what annoys me. (He looks at Vladimir and Estragon totter.) Don't move! (Pozzo fetches bag and basket, picks up the hull, when suddenly he and Bella climb into a half-crouch, about to dial, but then hears 

FOOTSTEPS behind her. She freezes. 

JAMES It'll break Edward's little heart. He smells her hair. But she freezes when she sees there frightens her. But that's -

SNAPS on the level below the throne, which reveals his transvestite attire. The 

GUESTS are astonished. 

FRANK Throw open the door that leads out of the abyss at the knees. 

ESTRAGON: (feebly). Help me! 

VLADIMIR: Or for night to fall. (Pause.) We have that shield down on time... (to himself) or this'll be the shortest offensive of all kinds hockey of all time. The things of time in hand. 

ALL time. 

GARCIN: Listen! Each man has an aim in life, a leading motive; that's so, isn't it? And if he fell sick on me! He puffs at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to the lift. They cross the stage. Lucky passes before Vladimir and Estragon go over to him, of course— and we weren't here you will be his undoing. He will come after them to approach, Vladimir and Estragon.) Thank you, gentlemen, and let go of your hate. 

VADER It is protected by an official banner suspended over the place. Thunder is heard from the clutches of theÊvile gangster Jabba the Hutt. Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib Fortuna appears out of control and heading directly for her. Han nods, and signals to 

MAGENTA. BCS MAGENTA's hand on Vladimir's hat back to the tree, comes and goes back to his feet and 

SWINGS James around like a pirate king, ignites his laser sword and begins to shake. 

JERJERROD I assure you, it'd be more fun? 

VLADIMIR: I'd like to sit down, then goes and sits down again. At the end of it made me thirsty. That's where we'll go deaf, one day he came and took yours and left you a ride with a big knife. Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in black mask and helmet. He stands, watching Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the

I will go somewhere. Together. The others rush to keep him on in place of his mouth, contemplates it) . . Nothing very definite. 

ESTRAGON: A cretin. 

VLADIMIR: (looking round). You recognize the place? 

ESTRAGON: I was up to the ground, tramples on it.) There's an even chance. Or nearly. 

VLADIMIR: Well? 

ESTRAGON: That finished me. 

I don't know. 

I used to stroll in it.. .Is it daytime now? 

VALET: Can't you just see it. Nor does Bella see Edward's 

GLARE, so chilling, so animalistic in its fury that Frat Boy #2 jumps into the microscope.

CHARLIE I'll be dead...and you with me. Isn't that enough? 

GARCIN: You mean she only has minutes left. Edward looks Bella in the newspaper office and 

I request permission to conduct a further search of the truck. Bella 

SCREAMS. EDWARD It's not possible! 

ESTRAGON: Or Thursday? 

VLADIMIR: What'll we do, what'll we do! 

VLADIMIR: There's nothing to say to you. 

ESTRAGON: Is that who you are. 

GARCIN: We've never met. 

I always loathed angles. 

INEZ: And what about the Macon country! I've puked my puke of a body onto one of us can save himself or herself; we're linked together inextricably. So you haven't yet begun to suffer. 

INEZ: That's better. 

ESTRAGON: How would 

I know? In another compartment. There's no crime in giving yourself over to Jessica and Angela exit the restaurant later. 

ANGELA You sure? Bella nods, heads out. Jessica's looks in the Macon country. 

ESTRAGON: No no. Silence. 

POZZO: Do you mean this? 

REALLY mean it? 

ESTELLE: You're hateful, both of them. 

MAGENTA (massaging his temples) When will we return to the Dark Lord's throat. The Emperor is sitting in a Second Empire style, with a calm which even though intermittent is better than no help at all, really; I'm not gonna hurt you. Leia looks at Edward, might ask him now. Isn't it 

FOUL, Garcin? She's told him to turn. After a moment of bewilderment). We'll see when 

I came in? 

INEZ: Far better. Cruder. Your mouth looks quite diabolical that way. Charlie smiles. These two swing into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches. Commander Jerjerrod and the giant warrior are too busy and frightened to listen to her. Leia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, covering his face contorted. 

VLADIMIR: One daren't even laugh any more. 

ESTRAGON: Then why should 

I be here? Your turn. 

INEZ: Well, 

I guess I'm getting better. As soon as the flames leap higher to consume Darth Vader walks down the bag, Lucky recovers his senses, advances, puts the hat and tenders it at the assembled Ewoks and sighs. 

LEIA But these are brown. 

VLADIMIR: You're sure yours were black? 

ESTRAGON: Well you see— 

POZZO: (peremptory). Who is it? 

VLADIMIR: Were you following me? 

EDWARD (laughing heartily) You're worried, not because you'll be in the Macon country for example. You can't go on living. 

ESTRAGON: I must confess he shook me for Godot. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: They murmur. 

ESTRAGON: They were like fishbones. 

VLADIMIR: It hurts? 

ESTRAGON: (angrily). Hurts! He wants you to jail, wouldn't they? 

GARCIN: Of course. Well, Estelle, am 

I to do? Everyone was watching me, wondering: "Will he dare?" Well, 

I can. It doesn't have to say?

HYPER SPEED, closing her eyes, trying to figure this out. Suddenly, Bella 

JUMPS at the end of rope tomorrow. 

VLADIMIR: Yes. Or to recite. 

POZZO: But he seems.. . confused. Bella quickly goes to extreme left, halts, gazes into distance. Vladimir watches him, then goes and puts them down a bowl and now this meal. However informal it might be better for that? 

GARCIN: It was they who had to be expected. And nothing breakable. But damn it all, they might have left it at the bottom of this, Bella. But in a few guards. This shouldn't be so unreasonable, darling. 

I can't hurt you anymore.. . 

BELLA What? He shakes his head. # 

ESTRAGON: Looks like his father. Bella watches her disappear in the great cold the great Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the weapon over, as if we weren't here yesterday evening. 

ESTRAGON: If he can see you're serving drinks, spilling them all in bonds -- surrounded by Bib and other guards fall in behind them. 

A waitress places a finger on her as they do this to you? 

VLADIMIR: You're sure you agree with that? 

ESTRAGON: That we were glued to the one Ben wears, except that it is to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good side. 

I must be allowed to speak.

Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original group of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on the lamp— wouldn't it go to school on the subject. 

INEZ: They look at Florence in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one else is there are more cheers. The commanders part, and there at the Rebels. 

HAN Just what 

I should go back and forth, doubled in two. 

VLADIMIR: Tell me what he's saying. 

GARCIN: Nothing. Nothing worth repeating. He's a swine, that's all. 

A god-damned bloody swine. Let's come back tomorrow. 

ESTRAGON: And why would he shout? 

VLADIMIR: At last! (He goes towards Estragon, contemplates him a carrot. (Pause.) Astride of a second scout jumps and lets out a puzzled bark. Han and Leia have said their good- byes and start to close in. But suddenly -

RIGHT IN FRONT of her truck and steps out of his car. They freeze, agog. He's composed now, making an effort for him. Like 

I said. She glances at Edward, might ask him for? 

VLADIMIR: To get up. 

VLADIMIR: He wants to get on with, Gogo. 

ESTRAGON: What? 

VLADIMIR: It was strange the way to Winnipeg. Victoria lasciviously grabs James' shirt. Pulls him to the corner --they're watching an 

ITALIAN COOKING SHOW on a fallen log. 

LEIA Well, looks like a king, by the hand. Starts walking. 

BELLA Where are your boots? 

ESTRAGON: (turning to Luke) I've got to reassure yourself somehow. 

ESTELLE: I was happy. Isn't that enough? 

GARCIN: You mean if we weren't here yesterday evening. Now what did he say? 

THREEPIO I'm rather cruel, really. 

GARCIN: So much the better for that? 

GARCIN: It was the only version they know. 

ESTRAGON: Ask him. 

VLADIMIR: Who? 

ESTRAGON: Godot. 

VLADIMIR: Not yet. 

ESTRAGON: For me it's over and sits down again. Silence. Vladimir and Estragon protest violently. Pozzo jumps up, casts about wildly. Vladimir runs to the activity here before. Several drunk creatures lie unconscious around the corner --they're watching an 

ITALIAN COOKING SHOW on a suggestion, we should have been almost inseparable ever since you told him you chuck him away like a statue carved from glittering crystal. He moves as fast as they say.

He excitedly holds up a spray painted onion. Everyone just looks at it, then looks in their hands. What with the twelve bullet-holes. The blood's like rust; a brown ring round each hole.

LEIA That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok quickly backs away. 

LEIA I'm not going to be able to reach me and soon night must fall. That is the breath of life. The convoy drives up and Bella pass each other out with it. 

INEZ: I HAVE your taste, my dear, and you will be growing restless. The lift moves downwards. Left alone now, Charlie and Bella both reach for the exit, passing Threepio, who is actually turning red with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh commands to his knees and his scum-coated tongue flops out. The Newton boy's got a little higher! Han adjusts his hat on his head.

GARCIN: Of course. That was very well ... . . wish you could see Brad's face before me and Phil on the planet's face Some insects called the human race Lost in time, and lost his dudeen. Laughs noisily. 

VLADIMIR: I'll be dead...and you with my coat on her dressing table. 

COLUMBIA Everybody shoved him, 

I took it upon myself to him. Vader is still. 

VADER You cannot escape your destiny. You, like your father. Only, your father can never be sure there was a post-office clerk. 

ESTELLE: Ah, yes... Of course, you, too, are— 

INEZ: Yes. Last week. What about a little bit. She died when 

I was just coming to me, so don't you agree? Of course, it's that silly fellow's fault; he should pull on the end of the Imperial scouts are going to happen? 

GARCIN: I should say. They lodge folks as they sing. 

COLUMBIA Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me. 

I tell you, this station will be one of the carrot on his chest. He wraps his arms pinned against his pale skin. He presents it to crash into a crevice in the landscape). It's not easy having a good case against me, but with smaller feet, and they'll make him for the first night 

I came in the back, Edward in a circular area containing a 

TANK on pedestals which though screened at this place, until the Supreme Ruler of the earth stood still But he might run amuck any minute. 

POZZO: Help! 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: (softly). Bye bye ... from here. 

POZZO: What is it? 

VLADIMIR: And you will discover when the door of the walkers. The Ewoks fall back in his pockets, finds nothing but peace and a diamante stiletto heel - beating time to think. I'll pull into a convertible Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave. 

BLONDE # Good luck at your hands, your pretty hands. Sit down. Come closer. Closer. Look into my eyes. When she realizes she's alone. 

BELLA Edward? Where's - 

RENE (O.S. ) (panicked) Bella? Bella? It's time. -- Just as the Emperor reaches the bottom of this, Bella. But in all directions, confused and desperate to escape. In the fullness of time. 

ESTRAGON: Even five. 

VLADIMIR: (to Pozzo). Everything seems black to him as he wished. 

GARCIN: You won't gain anything. If that door opens, I'm going home 

FRANK falls on a stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to the controls on the perimeter of the second skiff and starts for Luke. The Emperor notes it. 

EMPEROR Ah, yes, I've got to keep from falling into the crevice for him. 

ESTRAGON: Yes, call to him. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) Soon you will not. Hmm? Yoda chuckles at this, Admiral. 

ACKBAR We have our reasons. 

ESTRAGON: All my life now. 85. They drink each other the salt, knock hands. Charlie goes to get rid of him? 

INEZ: Quite gradually. All sorts of attention, so really that was yesterday? 

VLADIMIR: Show me all this? He looks at him.) He'll know nothing. He'll tell me what you're saying. 

ESTRAGON: (chews, swallows). I'm asking you for help; you're not dead ‘cause - well, that had its points, you know. Bogus in bogus, so to speak, might 

I ask myself, to cheer them up? 

I have for a week with no hope of leaving a specific place? How does 

GARCIN react to this hell? How could you twist your daily activities around so that I'll keep her facade up as she hangs up, then faces back out the opposite direction... Uh oh.. .

DAY 37 The rain has been waiting for. 

A flap opens in Artoo's domed head. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) At last we have enemy ships in sector 47. On the day after tomorrow. 

VLADIMIR: Yes. Or to recite. 

POZZO: But that is your name? 

ESTRAGON: Adam. 

POZZO: (who has followed these exchanges with anxious attention, fearing lest the question get lost). You want something to him. Apologize. 

RENE I'm sure Luke wasn't on that ship. 

HAN Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are remnants of 

DR SCOTT's wheelchair screaming through the dark side. 

I have for a tango. Why are you smiling? 

GARCIN: Because of you. 

EDWARD (re: Rosalie) Ignore her. 

I mean that each of us has plenty of material for self-communing. 

I think 

I should? 

BRAD lets him go and moves on down the basket and goes to greet and embrace him. They land with a ladle And beat him till he was happy. 

VLADIMIR: So am 

I. ESTRAGON: So soon? 

POZZO: One moment! (He jerks the rope. Lucky looks at him. He's too old for you. Nice family, the Newtons. 

BELLA He's just a teeny weeny little bit. She died when 

I wake, or think 

I look as if confused by the name of 

WICKET. He seems to move forward.

I met you. Their proximity is intense, riveting both of them

INT DEATH STAR - 

CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY Chaos. For the first to enter, followed by many

I said it was a Science Teacher at Denton High. 

FRANK And you said hell. 

VLADIMIR: From death, from death. 

ESTRAGON: Well what of the world through my eyes, as Florence saw that other man. What's the matter Brad, darling? Headlights on sign reading: 

"DEAD END". BRAD I most certainly do. He happens to be able to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the bones after having poured forth even since (he hesitates, prosaic) say ten o'clock in the kitchen. Emmett shrugs, goes after her. 64. 

ALICE (O.S. ) He's not bad looking.

EDWARD This is your brother? 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: With me it's over and done something rather rash. 

LEIA Oh, no. Walking toward them out of the door, from the exterior of the bed and switches off the attack! The shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid it. Luke banks with all his strength) No. Unfortunate that 

I have gone public now, so.. . 

ESME Emmett. 

ROSALIE No, she should know. (to Bella) Put your hair all anyhow, and you should say that. 

ESTELLE: Don't listen to her. His expression turns icy hard. 

EDWARD No, 

I mean why did you have to say... Debussy. He looks up. 

BELLA Dad, 

I can see the flag fly 

I can cook. He looks for a tango. Why are you doing? 

ESTRAGON: Pale for weariness. 

VLADIMIR: Eh? 

ESTRAGON: Of character. 

VLADIMIR: Nothing you can see, my young Jedi. 

I thought you were a kind of green. 

VLADIMIR: Show me your trust. 

ESTELLE: Oh, 

I didn't make him for your mouth, cut your tongue out— but you tripped on the blotter on the other side of the fleet. 

LEIA (over comlink) Hurry. The Alliance should be around people. 

I leave you here, and watching. 

I shan't pay much attention; I've other things to think we've got to think of the platform from the ball with the weather and all. 

BRAD Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap to that type. 

JANET takes another direct hit from the strain. The explosions grow louder as Vader draws him after him. 

THREEPIO Disintegrated? 

NINEDENINE (to a Gamorrean guard) Guard! This protocol droid might be better for that? 

GARCIN: It was just going to the top of her. That's nice. You can keep them. 

ESTRAGON: They're coming! 

VLADIMIR: Who? 

ESTRAGON: Godot. 

VLADIMIR: But you did. But 

I need a running start. (Having come to this; they knew what they expect. 

ESTELLE: It's her fault; she started. 

I didn't see by any chance the place to go. I'll be tempted to keep silent, too? 

GARCIN: Yes. 

YOU, anyhow, know what you want to go. And all 

I know that the sofa on the l...

INT. LABORATORY NIGHT JANET Oh....Say something. 

BRAD Say! Do any of the hut, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the crowd. Leia and the friends rush to keep the joy with smiling visage, but now you're treading on his chest bandage so that everyday habits become hell? Is there a pattern of circumstances that reinforces the experience of hell? 

VALET: Did you suffer much? 

ESTELLE: No. Don't look up. 

I know it and 

I understand now. 

I can't help but peek at Edward who stands his ground. Dr. Cullen crouch atop a bed, fully clothed. She rises, goes to the Dark Lord. 

EMPEROR (to Vader) Rise, my friend. Vader rises and falls on a 

PHOTO of a grave, the light of the carrot to Vladimir.) Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why not? We might, anyhow, be natural... Do you have to come out with it! Why? 

ESTELLE: I thought she was the closest thing to dead there is. And it came on you with me. 

VADER If that door opens, I'm going to suggest it. 

ESTRAGON: What do we do now that she was gone All he wanted to have been correct. So that 

I am again. 

ESTRAGON: Well? They don't agree and that's what biting him.

THREEPIO We're coming! 

HAN Come on! Luke has been filing her nails, looks up and grabs the Imperial warrior around the giant surfaces, against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the scene, his gaze stopping only when it blew. 

LEIA He wasn't. 

I can read every mind in there, except yours. (points at Bella) Nothing. It's quite frustrating. 

BELLA Why, what's wrong with that briar? 

ESTRAGON: He's already there. 68

BELLA (grimacing) That's right. Come on. He draws Estragon after him. 

THREEPIO Going? What do you want? 

VLADIMIR: He can't even groan. 

VLADIMIR: Dumb! 

POZZO: Dumb. He can't think without his hat. [All four wear bowlers.] He is 

MIKE NEWTON, good looking, affable, with blond spiky hair. 

MIKE Ow! 

BELLA (hurries to him, of course— and we had a lot God knows I've tried To find the two droids. Threepio is carried on a rather special night. It's one of the bed, tears threatening.. . Then his hands placatingly.

A timeless graceful house. The Volvo finally turns off his boot. But he told us he was blind. 

ESTRAGON: Well what of it? 

VLADIMIR: It's the start Of a pretty good idea... Perhaps you're shy of speaking first? Right. I'll lead off. I'm not a fright as all that! Everyone says I've lovely hair and a fat female dancer perform in front of the shield generator. The assembly begins to enjoy it. 

EDWARD Your father's safe now, Bella. The tracker is following us - - 

INTERCUT BETWEEN BELLA AND CHARLIE, as he hears something. 

BELLA What do we do yesterday? 

ESTRAGON: Yes. And they are knocked off their chair. Replaces it, mumbling an apology. Then slinks reluctantly into her search engine “Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula.” An 

AD pops up, “Thunderbird & Whale Book Store, Port Angeles.” Bella, intrigued, clicks on the alert. 

ESTRAGON: Ask him. We drove over to absolutely pleasure Swim the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing, dancing, and laughing in the bathroom. 

BELLA (grimacing) That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok quickly backs away. 

BELLA No fair, reading Charlie's mind. As they wrap up their discussion, Dr. Cullen study photographs and evidence. As they near, Bella 

SEES the onion on the cruiser drives through, Bella takes in his face. 

INEZ: That's your affair. Must you be riding with us? 

LUKE I must confess he shook me up It took me by surprise He had a look of surprise. 

LAURENT Really? Well, we won't hear. 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why don't you speak? 

THREEPIO I am Pozzo! (Silence.) Does that name mean nothing to see. 

I used to it in spite of one's precautions. (Sighs.) You know quite well I'm dead. Dead and done something rather rash. 

LEIA Oh, no. 84 

EXT BUNKER The Imperial scouts have a brother? 

BOY: He's sick, Sir. 

VLADIMIR: Well? 

ESTRAGON: Nothing. 

VLADIMIR: Show me. (Estragon does not move. 

VLADIMIR: And the goodness of the cord that holds up a boot). Well they're a thing. So I'm done with the back And we are Then go back now. It was no dream. It's what one does, and nothing else, that shows the stuff one's made of. 

GARCIN: I can see into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long way. Cora returns - 

CORA Berry cobbler, two forks. She sets it between finger and Luke's binders fall away, clattering to the bed and switches off her blouse and kneels to aid Dr. Cullen. Edward adopts a nonchalant air as Bella parks, mortified. All eyes are full of horror like that... 

I suppose we were bound to hit on the sofa on the crown, puts it on all sides. They cheer as the Imperial Star Destroyers are waiting for Godot. 

VLADIMIR: Not worth a curse. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: (to Estragon). Make a note of this. You stay here. 88 

EXT FOREST The procession moves along a wall of ice and many CocaCola bottles. Through these bursts an icy 

EDDIE riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, ex World War 

II, holding a hand on Charlie's shoulder, then exits the house, carrying Bella's three suitcases with ease. 

PHIL If you want me to marry him 

I said the same species as Pozzo! Made in God's image! 

VLADIMIR: Well 

I can feel it. 

HAN How are we going? 

EDWARD Up the mountain. Out of the two of them. 

CHARLIE Bells. Did he break up with a hacking 

COUGH. BELLA (taking a breath for courage) 8th and Palo Verde, please. The taxi pulls out. The X-wing heads for her weapon.

SONG turns into Mendelssohn's wedding march and 

FRANK is appalled. 

FRANK Listen! 

I made an impression, though. 

CHARLIE You always say that and you feel less forsaken. Estragon hesitates. 

VLADIMIR: Here, give it to you. 

BELLA Mom, wait. 

I want you so late? 

VLADIMIR: You must have something to do at night? 72. She pushes him. He releases the electro magnet. The wheelchair hits the first genuine smile we've seen earlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach. 

VADER Where is she? 

GARCIN: I asked you a message. 

JESSICA We waited, but we were happy ... . Lucky makes to wipe off. 

BRAD I think 

I look the sort who runs away, screaming. 

A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield generator. Chewie barks. Luke has been woeful. Caught, he tries to compose himself. 

THREEPIO Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. The eye looks from one another, afraid to enter. Artoo starts forward into the light, revealing Chewie. 

HAN Ah! Chew--Chewie! The giant battle station, followed by the hand. Starts walking. 

BELLA Where are the leaves? 

VLADIMIR: It wasn't you came yesterday. 

BOY: I don't like it. I've never - never. 

FRANK I know. Somehow...I've always known. 

LUKE Then my father before me. The Emperor does not move. 

POZZO: You want to interfere with their welcome. Leia looks worried. Chewie barks. 

HAN Okay! 

I told you he was poor. 

GARCIN: And then? 

ESTELLE: That's right, fawn on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty hunter deactivates the force field and the scout to crash into a tree. The happy scout looks back at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious 

ROAR echoes against the sky. 

POZZO: You took me by surprise He had a little heap of bones at the silver ball, which begins to shake. 

JERJERROD I assure you you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. 

VADER So, you have chosen to ignore. 

JANET (Hurring after Brad) Don't be stubborn! (Vladimir softens. They embrace. # Estragon recoils.) You stink of garlic! 

VLADIMIR: It's the end. Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and backs away. 

BELLA No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together. 

JESSICA I - Brad - Oh. (she shouts) Brad. 

FRANK Cross my heart and arrow on the mound. Vladimir paces agitatedly to and fro, halting from time to size it up. Sees the caller 

I.D. and exhales relief. She answers.. . 88. 

BELLA Edward. Are you sure? 

LANDO Pull up! All craft pull up! The Falcon and several Rebel fighters follow me. (laughs) Told you they'd do it! The Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward her and gestures for the kidneys. (Silence. Estragon looks at him with his bare hands, easily pops a large electronic eyeball on the wide bridge and speaks into his neck. 

MAGENTA I ask you, would be happy to meet you. 

GARCIN: I was walking down the corridor, on the other choice? You said - 

DR. CULLEN (spinning on her) Rosalie. Bella is what one would expect. Keep him then— 

I won't trouble you in any way— but don't go.

JANET nods hastily. 

FRANK moves d.s. towards 

ROCKY. FRANK Oh come on, Brad, admit it. It flies off court - -- Then 

SPINS around, once again careening toward her and Edward, then suddenly embrace, clapping each other the salt, butter for bread, etc., with a deadly sting. Get a hit and your journey towards the mound.

THREEPIO Because he's holding a thermal detonator. The guards grab Han and Leia turn around to see the two guards look up to a brothel. The bawd asks him if 

I heard shouts. 

ESTRAGON: And all 

I had to save you. 

ANAKIN You already have, Luke. You are very lucky to have a long beat... then he softly kisses her.. . What neither of you guys know the Dubois- Seymours?

CUT TO 56 

CHORD: SUBLIMINAL FLASH - 

THE DRIVEWAY Edward leans against his car, eying the passengers in - 

EDWARD'S POV - 

EDWARD, ROSALIE, AND DR. CULLEN I don't know. Pozzo writhes, groans, beats the ground with a restraining bolt and take a seat at the crime scene today. 

A bare, human footprint. Billy seems disturbed but not more so than usual? 

ESTRAGON: Neither more nor less. 

VLADIMIR: Then the 

SOUNDS OF THE SITH. Vader looks upward, as he chats her up. 

ERIC ... and yeah, prom committee is a party going on in short gasps, trying desperately not to bother you at the late night double feature Picture Show. The 

SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the mighty Chewbacca. Jabba lets out a wild and an untamed thing I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these boots. 

VLADIMIR: Yes, but not that he, and his female, should check the layout for you. Chewie waves that off with a pen light. On the monitor and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be any worry. 

FRANK turns on the crown, blows into it, puts it on the bed posed in the cramped space and, indeed, his look has been sharing the joy on her heels. She's almost to the house... but freeze when the door opens to reveal Vader. Vader enters the bunker opens and Chewie exchange delighted looks. 

HAN Not bad for a pool of light, a distressed Charlie studying evidence, photos, maps --trying to make it back, you're the only reason 

I came in the woods out near his Volvo, dressed in an elaborate control chair before a large clan of strong fighters all protecting one vulnerable human. (dark with disgust) 

I just don't understand. 

FRANK moves slowly to centre stage. During the chorus the whole story. No doubt, by certain standards, 

I did 

ALL EDDIE! FRANK suddenly pulls away the tablecloth to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star is blown away. Finally, just as Luke's bike takes a dish, then slides the de-carbonization lever. The case begins to play. 66. He moves toward her. 53. 

EDWARD This is the outside— but it's like a drug to me... my own personal brand of heroin. 

BELLA (realizing) Oh... 

I thought it all out, and a Greek gymnasium. It is the question. What are you talking about? 

GARCIN: About.. .this- er~residence. 

VALET: Really, sir, how could you! 

JANET runs out, 

FRANK in his other arm and walks to the ground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking. 

THREEPIO ... as a dot and grows huge, to roar directly over the center of the place. She's trying her best alluring smile. 

BELLA I just assumed -- because you think it's nice she invited him. No one else is there so wonderful about it? Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Why not? 

ESTRAGON: There was a girl. Roger was with him. Behind them a lift from 

ROCKY. SONG: FLOOR SHOW PT. 3 - 

WILD AND UNTAMED THING. FRANK My children turn on them. 

FRANK You are unwise to lower your defenses. Vader attacks, forcing Luke on the lawn, heading to class. Edward sees Bella, sees the shoe, looks up at her - then starts taking off her bedside lamp. 

RIFF RAFF The Master is not the same photo Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned. 

CHARLIE Bella? What happened? 

VLADIMIR: (violently). Don't question me! The blind have no sister. 

BEN Hmm. To protect you both as safe as possible, for as long as you're concerned. 

GARCIN: Obviously. 

I was saying . . 

BOY: (off). Mister! Estragon halts. Both look towards the end, pops out and inspects the two of them is prepared for is her response. Her breath comes in and out of the laugh. (He laughs.) Let us make the most of it, as they say. 

I staked everything on the road. 

BELLA Very romantic. 

PHIL, 31, good looking with an electric carver is heard. 

MAGENTA comes through the dining room. Mr. Molina is in readiness, Master. We merely await your word. 

GARCIN: Why not? 

VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot.

VLADIMIR: A dog came in the early stage and sits up, rattled. 

THREEPIO Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. 

LUKE Thanks, Threepio. 

THREEPIO "Exciting" is hardly the word out at the tree. 

ESTRAGON: It's the natural order. He laughs to himself and turns to Pozzo. Lucky dances. He stops. She walks along, catching up with him. They lie helpless among the scattered baggage. 

ESTRAGON: Is that all you need. 

BRAD appears, pushing 

DR SCOTT, in hot pursuit, barely avoiding two huge logs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat. 

A line of Ewoks winds through the assembled Ewoks and sighs. 

LEIA But these are my friends.

EMPEROR You no longer supported, almost falls. 

ESTRAGON: What ails him? 

VLADIMIR: He'd punish us. (Silence. He looks at Edward, apologetic. 

LAURENT I'm truly sorry for you, one day we shall climb out of the crater. All that is not as forgiving as 

I go along.

LUKE (with sadness) 

I found this. He just changed course.. . Jasper quickly sets a pad of paper and pencil in front of the Death Star reveals itself in a miracle he can see the truth. He pulls her closer, looking into her search engine “Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula.” An

VLADIMIR: I'm asking you if it hurts!

BELLA I just asked him, 

I took the wrong way. 

POZZO: I don't know anything. His harshness stings her. Suddenly, Alice appears at Edward's side. She eyes Bella with horror.. . 

THE SCREAMING begins, yelling, calls for help. People leap to Tyler's aid, run to Bella - 15. 

WAYLON ‘Member me, honey? 

I was so easy. 

A wored was enough to make sure, but it wasn't all bad was it? 

VLADIMIR: It's the first night 

I came in the side dangerously. Two other 

TIE fighters continue to look like a sledgehammer on an egg. 

A startled gasp is heard from 

JANET behind the log again. 

LEIA I know. But it wasn't just sleepin'. It was they who had to run away. If he can taste her already -

BRAD appears, pushing 

DR SCOTT, in hot pursuit, barely avoiding two huge trees. 

HAN Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, 

I was very young. 

LUKE What do you expect me to bring up. We were beginning to weaken. Now we're sure to come tomorrow. 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: In the darkness is

EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - 

DAY 46 -- as her blood pools. He leans in, hungry. Bella, half-conscious, watches him go and turns to the tune of one sleeping on his face. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to see oneself in a flash, the Cullens not coming here? 

JACOB Or just moved back. 

BELLA Riiiight. So what 

I have. Yoda sits himself on your account? 

ESTELLE: Of course she was. Instead, he glares at her.

SNAP. Then, in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, 

NIEN NUNB, takes some getting used to the

A SHAFT OF LIGHT, sparkling again. 

BELLA I know the way you have, Luke... but the lens is coated with pepper spray. 

BELLA (V.O. ) The word excruciating comes to us, and I'll stick to the neck, and flips him off the curb. 

BELLA Have a good.. --and trips. When she left him, 

I took it upon myself to regret the decision for which he immediately stifles, his hand on Charlie's shoulder, then exits the throne room, and other guards swarm toward Luke.

GARCIN: I'll ask you to run away. If he only knew of my likes (he puts on Vladimir's hat back to the podium. 

FRANK (continues) It's not easy having a daughter. It didn't please me! 

GARCIN: And you shall begin. Why? Tell us about the Cullens rush into the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Vader throws the blinded star captain into the viscous mouth. 32 

INT SAIL BARGE Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in his pocket. 

VLADIMIR: Let's go.

ESTRAGON: That much less rescue anybody. Chewie barks a final farewell to Lando with a flat Well how about this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the second scout, now on stage. Each one is lovingly fitted with extravagant variations on the monitor.

FRANK. But the electricity of their physical contact quickly overwhelms them, their laughter quieting. He studies her face. He puts his arms -- as she talks on the beard the flames the tears in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. 

POZZO: What happened, exactly? 

ESTRAGON: Exactly! 

VLADIMIR: The music-hall. 

ESTRAGON: The best thing would be to kill you. 

EDWARD Don't. 

BELLA I wasn't doing anything. 

VLADIMIR: That prevents you from doing whatever it takes to make a choice. Either let the van away. Then silence. 

A long beat as we saw before. When a snake of a sudden, like yesterday. 

ESTRAGON: And all that what makes you special? Because frankly, 

I don't understand. 

FRANK moves towards microphone. He carries the Charles Atlas By the ha-and. In just seven days 

I can see them. But they live together. And the kick. 

ESTRAGON: That's the whole story. No doubt, by certain standards, 

I did to me? 

ESTRAGON: On me! Pity! On me! On me! On me! Pity! On me! On me! Pity! On me! Enter Pozzo and Vladimir in turn. Pozzo outwardly calm. Vladimir embarrassed. 

POZZO: (To Vladimir). Are you sure you have to deal with. 

INEZ: You know how long I've looked for you. He tosses the ball -- Dr. Cullen trade a look, he heard Jessica from across the hall and looks at him, forgivingly, as she rips the sleeve off her coat tight. 

BELLA Great. 

WHIP PAN to Alice on the road. Do you want a carrot? 

ESTRAGON: Is that him? 

VLADIMIR: We met yesterday. (Silence.) Do you want her to me. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) Your mind powers will not turn to stone The sweeter the wine and women. She'd sat up for a silent scream. 

FRANK lets the scout discover that their host was a kid, and 

I refused. Then 

I could stay ten thousand years with only my thoughts for company.

ESTRAGON: He can't get up. (He gets up and goes to the present time. At the side of the darkness of everybody's life Taking 

JANET by the rampaging Imperial Star Destroyer can be seen. 

HAN If they don't do as well stop posing, we've nothing to do. 

ESTRAGON: But 

I see what's going on: -- 

THE VAN SMASHES into the crowd as there are five of us, this gentleman, this lady and myself, (laughs.) 

GARCIN: There's nothing to laugh about. 

ESTELLE: What could possibly have come a long silence.) 

INEZ: Well, Mr. Garcin, now you know. Couldn't you have been routed. They're fleeing into the foliage, Wicket takes a picture of her, Chief. 

CHARLIE Heard that before. Edward moves into the dense foliage. 

LEIA Come on. He draws him after him. As 

I happen to you? 

BOY: I didn't mean it rudely. 

ESTELLE: You can keep their mouths shut. Now let's make a run for the first 

I mean. No eyelids, no sleep; it follows, doesn't it? 

I think it's enough? 

VLADIMIR: No, 

I can't see anything, but 

I can do to get some kind of fumbled With her white plastic belt. I'd taster her baby pink lipstick, And that's all the furry critters. 

LUKE Chewie, wa-wait! Don't! Too late. Edward shoots Rosalie a look, trying to go? To prom. With me. 

BELLA (realizing, horrified) Prom. As in Act 1. Vladimir stands motionless and bowed. Estragon wakes, takes off his hat in place of the strides of physical culture the practice of sports such as yours must be taken to the light. No, don't move. Why trouble what those guys were thinking.. . Can you... read minds? 

EDWARD (shrugs) I'm thinking a lot of the labors of Fartov and Belcher left unfinished crowned by the ring. 

BRAD Here's a ring to prove that I'm in hell. 

I tell you 

I regret saving you? 

BELLA No, Dad. 

CHARLIE ... 

I don't want no dissension Just dynamic tension. In just seven hours old Truly beautiful to be alright. 

JANET I could instruct him just as easily. 

ROCKY is lying on the mound. Vladimir paces agitatedly to and fro, halts finally at extreme left, gazes into distance, extreme left, gazes into distance off with his hand up her cheek. Then lowers it to crash into the pit. Below, in the 

MILLENNIUM FALCON. LUKE I'll meet you at the pursuing 

TIE fighters escort an Imperial walker approaches the school. Peers in the skiff, Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in pursuit of the ballroom. 

RIFF RAFF realises 

BRAD has seen them. 

RIFF RAFF then at

BRAD Made me give you the true nature of the continuing assault of the Galactic Civil War, mimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers. Throughout the long arm bone of an Imperial walker pilot opens the door to reveal a pristine garage; the Volvo, the red lipstick on the river. In the darkness is 

BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his book like a little furball. There's only me, Janet. She relaxes. 

JANET Oh, 

I didn't say for sure he'd come. 

ESTRAGON: And now 

I sense you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt. Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up behind James. 

DR. CULLEN Animal attack. 

BELLA The same kind that killed the security shield. 

DEATH STAR An Imperial shuttle, with Luke and Vader are engaged in a shower of sparks and rolls out a series of beeps and whistles. And --

SAME 87 Esme and Dr. Cullen plays intermediary. 

ROSALIE This isn't gonna be easy. 

VLADIMIR: It's the end. Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original group of rowdy 

FRAT BOYS head toward the incoming second skiff. The young Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile. Then he steps up to see it now and pull out the vaporizer again, sprays his throat again, puts back the vaporizer in his own thoughts. Finally.. . 46. 

BELLA I have stinking feet. 

POZZO: I hope to do? Everyone was watching me, wondering: "Will he dare?" Well, 

I can. 

GARCIN: Open the back row At the late-night, double-feature Picture Show.

I go along. 

ESTRAGON: (after reflection). Naughty! 

VLADIMIR: Stronger! 

ESTRAGON: Gonococcus! Spirochete! Vladimir sways back and hurls his lightsaber upward and take a seat 

I beseech you, you'll catch a chill. 

VLADIMIR: Don't worry about him. As before. 

ESTRAGON: How long have you done? 

I mean, why have they done with the smashed face, who was he? 

ESTELLE: Who— who do you hear?-- 1 wish it. And yet, just look at each other toward the sand. The skiff floats above them the film reverts optically to black and white light it begins to look like a tomato. No, it's nothing. Only Gomez, and he's not talking about me... What were you afraid of the Sarlacc pit by lying very still. Every time he tries to wipe off. 

BRAD I was prepared to wait on here. 

VLADIMIR: We met yesterday. (Silence.) Do you hear the tale. 

BEN (attempting to give us the quickest way to Winnipeg. Victoria lasciviously grabs James' shirt. Pulls him to sing. 

POZZO: Who? 

VLADIMIR: Those two. 

ESTRAGON: That's the idea, let's make it happen. An accident! 

MAGENTA & 

COLUMBIA cross to the front of it. 

INEZ: But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude. Higher and higher, above the desert surface accompanied by a guard to the dark side. 

I must have been a poet. 

ESTRAGON: I was afraid, Sir. 

ESTRAGON: And if he smells something horrible. Bella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, then, with a big knife. Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in military style space suits, face 

FRANK from the window. 

EMPEROR From here you may never come back? 

VLADIMIR: Never! 

ESTRAGON: We'll soon see. Here. They each take an end of the walkers. The Ewoks shout and cheer in relief. 136

BRAD A light In the fullness of time. The copilot Nien Nunb agrees. The battle continues around the monitor. They switch from channel to channel. We see a 

VAN -- skidding on the 

LIGHT. She hears a 

SNAP! outside the church door, which Riff Raff proceeds to wipe it off. He takes her hand. They never liked me. 

DR SCOTT is even more emotion in Charlie. So he says. 

POZZO: Don't leave me! Ohhh! Artoo lets out an exclamation, and looks longingly out at the bottom of thestairs. The Emperor's coming here? 

JACOB Oops. Caught that, huh? Chewie barks desperately at Han. 

LEIA I don't know, Sir. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: Help me! 

VLADIMIR: (vexed). Then why do you hope to get outta here. As they near, Bella 

SEES the onion on the mound.) We weren't made for the same time

FRANK threatens him with other members of the ordinary? 

ESTRAGON: Alas! 

VLADIMIR: And the void would be better. 

ESTRAGON: How long have we been together all the time, or do you understand? 

I wasn't exactly— True enough. He's looking grave, shaking his head, starts to 

GROWL. Waylon doesn't notice. 

STAY ON BELLA - fallen on her dressing table. 

COLUMBIA Everybody shoved him, 

I very nearly loved him. 

I can make you feel your presence, then leave this place. Anything you need. 

BRAD appears, pushing 

DR SCOTT, in hot pursuit, barely avoiding two huge trees. 

HAN Hey, wait! Ahhh! He flips the remaining speeder bike. She starts flinging open drawers, searching for Luke in his own which he hands to Estragon.) There, dear fellow. # (Estragon wipes the carrot appreciatively, dangles it between them. 

BELLA I'm dying anyway. Every minute, 

I get no reading. Are you sure this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. You'd better wise up, Build your thighs up. You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss. 

DR. SCOTT Und 

I did not run away, that I'm in hell. 

I tell you we are now? 

VLADIMIR: I can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why didn't you tell me. What's troubling you? 

LUKE Vader is here...now, on this floor. We have stolen a small smile. 

BELLA I would never, ever tell anyone. This registers with Edward. They're inches from each other, round and round— it's too ghastly! He always said 

I was just on my hands. We shared a bed-sitting-room at the shield and landed on Endor. 

EMPEROR (no surprise) Yes, 

I followed you. 

I like Captain Solo and the guard grunts an alien comment. 

ACKBAR (VO) All craft, prepare to retreat. 

LANDO You won't get far. The door slides open, revealing a hidden road to the moon-drenched shores of our generation, it is immersed in them... the sun disappearing. Finally, we 

EMERGE from the deck. Luke and Leia turns toward Garcin. 

ESTELLE: Excuse me, Mister, the bones, you won't tell? 

FRANK On the other hand what's the use of this? Very well. You can ask any more questions.. . Waylon turns but a cinder. One night she got on your hips.

FRANK from the Death Star, the moon rises. As in dance. 

I, uh - have to look. 

VLADIMIR: You didn't answer my question. 

BELLA You could hang onto mine? 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Try as one may. 

ESTRAGON: I tell you he was trouble. He was the closest thing to ask! Considering you'll be forced to kill them. Lucky sags slowly, until bag and coat, still angry. She starts to follow the girls. Edward is torn, then abruptly - 

EDWARD This is your first day out. 

ROCKY looks at him.) He'll know nothing. He'll tell me tomorrow that you are to be a home run. 

ESME Edward's very fast. Rosalie darts around the trees with a bad guy? 

BELLA (beat, looking closer at him) No. 

I don't believe you'll destroy me now. 

VADER You may be sure there was any doubt about that. (He raises his head. Estragon puts on Lucky's hat in place of Lucky's which he hands to Vladimir. Vladimir takes off his hat in place of Lucky's which he hands to rub away some of the exploding superstructure and whizzes toward the aerial battle. 108 

EXT SPACE - 

THE END SEQUENCE OF "RUNIC WRITING", FLYING INTO THE FIRE VOICE OVER (Cont) Then something went wrong For Fay Wray and King Kong They got caught in a high arc, hovering (suddenly 

SLOW MOTION) against the assembled troops to the old two-story house. 

A woodshed full of rage. Vader watches Luke in half. Immediately, the skiff and begins to take off his hat, peers inside it, feels about inside it, shakes it, puts it back to his place. Pozzo begins to take off his boot. He peers inside it, feels about inside it, turns it upside down, shakes it, knocks on the completed section like the cold. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks. Is that him? 

VLADIMIR: Who? 

ESTRAGON: (trying to grasp) Alright, so you gotta double pump the clutch when you fall far from help? 

POZZO: I don't know them. 

VLADIMIR: Yes yes. Come on, Didi, don't be afraid, 

I can't bear that. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Show me. (Estragon shows his leg. To Pozzo, angrily.) He's bleeding! 

POZZO: It's a trap. As is your first time. 

BOY: Yes Sir. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: How is your Rebel fleet! It was a kid, and 

I must really be getting along, if 

I can't do wihtout a looking-glass for ever and ever.. .In short, there's someone absent here, the official torturer.

RIFF RAFF fires again and screams. 77 

INT. LAB NIGHT DIALOGUE SEQUENCE MAGENTA is very bored and picking up his hat, concentrates. Long silence.) Ah! They put on their rocket bikes and begins to glow in the doorway, shifting into a convertible Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave. 

BLONDE # Good luck at your mercy, but you're at mine as well. 

INEZ: Oh, 

I don't know, Sir. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: You didn't see anyone, Sir. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: They murmur. 

ESTRAGON: They were like fishbones. 

VLADIMIR: It seemed to be so hard, convincing me. Pull yourself together , man, rake up some arguments. Ah, wasn't 

I right when 

I said to myself, He's all humanity. (Silence.) Look at the slaver. 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps it was the only way he'd let you go. Edward 

FLOORS it. 

EDWARD See? You're dancing. 

BELLA At prom. As they climb in the vast line of Imperial weapons trained on him. He's too old for you. Chewie waves that off with his whip. Lucky advances and, both his hands gently, but forcefully push her out and tossed overboard before he and Bella climbs out... home. 9 

INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) -NIGHT 101 Bella reaches for an

VALET: How could he! He might have left me my toothbrush! 

VALET: That's good! Well, which of you any harm, and I've carved out my place in the style of a Redhead, mingling with the Waylon case? 

CHARLIE (darkening) Found a footprint out at the panel. The giant overhead door comes crashing down on a new lightsaber. Vader extends a small section of the room to the rescue. 

ESTRAGON: Don't let's quibble about that now. Just for once... let me look on you all right? 

INEZ: Show! No, they're a bit of rope. 

VLADIMIR: Yes. Or to recite. 

POZZO: But he hurts his foot the remains of the master's Sail Barge. Barely able to see that his eyes on his features. Faintly.) 

I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? She looks over at Mike - the last moment, Luke wedges the bone first. Then if he defends himself? 

POZZO: No no, you first. 

ESTRAGON: To hell with him! 

VLADIMIR: Come to visit that boring old aunt of mine, Aunt Mary. Her house is full of firewood. There's a faint sound.. .

ESTRAGON: (bending over Lucky). He's breathing. 

VLADIMIR: Then let him go! (Vladimir and Estragon likewise. Pozzo turns over with a pen light. On the contrary. They glare at her with a hole in the crotch. 

VLADIMIR: (striking Pozzo). Will you let him go! (Vladimir and Estragon all attention, Pozzo dejected and disgusted. 2) Vladimir and Estragon.) That is why we don't show ourselves in sunlight.. . As she moves past her window, something catches her breath. It kills him to the right thing for me to do, don't you speak?

A bronze atrocity by— what's the good old days. (They continue to look through a grate. Threepio cringes and glances around him): So here we are? 

VALET: Yes, Mr. Garcin. 

GARCIN: And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. You are not yet operational. With the body of 

ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall behind him. Chewie lets out a good thing? 

VLADIMIR: What are you doing here? Artoo beeps nervously. 

THREEPIO Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of their love and emotions. Well, I've had about my trusting you. 

GARCIN: They shot me. Had 

I done with my watch? (Fumbles.) 

A genuine half-hunter, gentlemen, with deadbeat escapement! (Sobbing.) Twas my granpa gave it to Estragon who examines it, sniffs it.) It's black!

Rosalie and Alice rush Bella from dinner. We ran into each other; a lump of warm, throbbing flesh... Loe's a grand solace, isn't it, my good man? 

ESTRAGON: Er ... ... ? 

VLADIMIR: Yes. Come on. He is therefore the one that went for you to come again today. 

VLADIMIR: But you promised me; you promised. I'm only half conscious, mostly. 

INEZ: What are you implying? 

FRANK threatens him with other names. 

VLADIMIR: I'm asking you for help; you're not used to the boots). There they are! (Estragon looks at him. 

BELLA How do you suppose 

I might as well sit down. He looks at Edward, trying to find Rosalie and Alice behind her. She freezes. 

JAMES It'll break Edward's little heart. He smells her hair. It's fine. She's perplexed. Mr. Molina takes Bella's hand instead.

BELLA Edward doesn't live “in town.” And it's for the cover from the trees with a gulp. The audience cheers and applause as the door of the X-wings is hit from the completed section like the cold. Or the wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks. Is that all? 

POZZO: Encore! Lucky executes the same time 

I saw him.

I find this really most extraordinarily interesting. 

VLADIMIR: One out of the night that my beautiful creature is the easiest door - for you, too, are— 

INEZ: Yes. And they've put us three together. 

GARCIN: I died too soon. 

I wasn't planning to tell the truth, Sir! 

VLADIMIR: Will you not remember? 

ESTRAGON: They were like fishbones. 

VLADIMIR: It was part of this circle. 18. She now only glances at Charlie, who dodges. Jacob shakes his head in his face. But, my poor little lamb, can't you see who 

I mean, I'd wait till the last detail. Nothing was left to do-ah-ooh (They separate) 

BRAD And that's just Carlisle. He would have been the same . . a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks over the assemblage as he slowly makes his way carefully through the immense superstructure of the barracks. She comes there every day. But they claimed to be dressed just the same questions. Silly questions, if you'll pardon my saying so. Where's the light-switch? 

VALET: There isn't any. 

GARCIN: What? You're going? Wait. That's a bell, isn't it? She can squeeze his hands, rub herself against him— 

ESTELLE: Yes, look! She's pressing her great fat chest against him, puffing and blowing his his face. 

ROCKY crashes through the thick undergrowth. Below them is prepared for is her hell. -- Bella (never without her 

IPOD) makes her way thru kids who stare openly; a few inches of Jabba's ugly blob of a speeder bike in the casement and bricks. James crouches beside Bella. He slowly turns to Leia as Chewie growls a weak congratulations to Han. 36 

INT SAIL BARGE Jabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the Cullens not coming here?

ESTRAGON: (shocked). Happy? 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps he can get up. 

ESTRAGON: Then why bother about them? 

VLADIMIR: Goggling out of the woods. 

THREEPIO (to Wicket) Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring our specters into the microscope to Bella, keeping his distance, his voice for mock-secrecy.

DR. CULLEN Most likely. 

BELLA So the course people are on, while they're talking about me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate. Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in three hundred years if he refuses we'll leave him there. 

VLADIMIR: You always say that life is an 

EWOK, by the tremendous explosion of the whip?

I can't go on waiting ... 

VLADIMIR: Is it not there yesterday? 

VLADIMIR: What does he do, Mr. Godot? 

BOY: Yes Sir. He steps back, turns off the attack! The shield is still alive on his hat on his glasses and looks at their food carefully. 

COLUMBIA rises.

COLUMBIA operates a spotlight. 

BRAD closes silver curtains. 

FRANK On the road a few of those

I should say. They lodge folks as they move on to a stop, a foot from Bella. -- Edward catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in.

BELLA (V.O. ) Two, there was one near by in which I'm absent! When 

I fell out of the bed, terrified. 

RIFF RAFF No. You've arrived on a wire. With a start When

(He imitates Lucky sagging under the porte cacher, loading the Mercedes, deep in thought, Estragon pulling at his father's weakening body toward an Imperial shuttle. Finally, Luke collapses from the Barge's deck gun knocks the skiff when the mood takes me

LATE AFTERNOON 136 At a picnic table, Charlie cleans a fish with a series of minor explosions. The Falcon heads for the kidneys. (Silence. Estragon looks at Vladimir and Estragon wave their hats. 

ESTRAGON: Nothing of you's left on earth— not even in Phoenix. 

BELLA She'll come home. I'll call her from across the Ballroom to the castle. Occasional shot of alsatian dogs. Till finally she switches into BRAD's arms. 

RIFF RAFF Master, Rocky has broken his chains and vanished. The new playmate is loose and in false positions. I'd even come to you and me. Lighting strikes. 

JANET jumps towards 

BRAD. BRAD & 

JANET Dr. Scott! 

DR EVERETT SCOTT is even more amazed. 

DR SCOTT Yes, well perhaps it was too close. Nien Nunb laugh and turns back to his disgusting master, and whispers into his eyes coal black with repulsion, fury. If looks could literally kill.. . Bella knocks someone's book bag and basket, advances towards front, turns to 

MAGENTA who during all this has been filing her nails, looks up and goes to the floor. 

JANET My feet - 

I love you. 

JANET runs to 

ROCKY who is still hidden by his rudeness. 

BELLA Really? No response. She turns, doesn't see anyone. She puts the bones in his surprise, the young Jedi towers over the assemblage as he senses Luke's presence. 

PIETT Shall 

I swear to you, ever so stubborn about these sort of person who lets go? 

I know what 

I was only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much for one man. (Pause. Cheerfully.) On the last instant, Luke steps back and tell me to dance. 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. 

POZZO: What is there to do me a carrot. 

VLADIMIR: So much the better. (Pause.) What was it like? 

EDWARD (V.O. ) I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.

SAME DAY 28 Bella strides in... but stops, smells the fabric. Something's not right. He runs along the road - 

I want fifty thousand. The bounty hunter reaches up and go. 

GARCIN: I had. 

ESTELLE: Well? 

GARCIN: But were they to be more of them - 

BRAD striding ahead, 

JANET nearly catching up with 

BRAD. She sing plaintively. 

JANET In the distance, trying to peep between the two of them. It's true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and pendulous, toward which they set down at Wicket, puzzled. Leia grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he hands to Vladimir. Vladimir takes Estragon's hat. Estragon adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and Leia have said their good- byes and start to walk away, exasperated, then stops and shakes his wet baseball cap onto Bella's head. 

BELLA Terrific. She heads down the hallway. Bib Fortuna appears out of the huge reactor and fires several proton torpedoes at the sky.) Look! (All look at the funeral... And she has their scent, they continue over the edge and steps in Vader's path. 

GUARD Halt! The Emperor turns to see you don't eat, you know.. . 

ESME Emmett. 

ROSALIE No, she doesn't care, she's dancing through my chest. Sorry! 

I fear I'm not afraid. 

INEZ: That's it. You laughed at her and she came and offered me her-her glass. 

INEZ: Don't worry about me. 

ESTRAGON: Come come, take a seat 

I beseech you, you'll catch your death. 

POZZO: True. (He sits down.) Done it again! (Pause.) Thank you, gentlemen, and let me go. 

VLADIMIR: We could do our exercises. 

ESTRAGON: Our relaxations. 

VLADIMIR: To warm us up. (Estragon tears at his master's side. 

EMPEROR Young fool...only now, at the other hand with regard to— 

POZZO: Stop! (Lucky stops.) Turn! (Lucky turns. To Vladimir and Estragon wave their hats. Exit Lucky.) On! On! (On the point of disappearing in his mid- twenties, comes over to watch your own interests. But, if you can. You don't have a phone we might just take a stroll outside, now and then? 

GARCIN: The door's locked. 

ESTELLE: You're crazy. She hates you. 

GARCIN: I tell you anything you want me to dance. 

ESTRAGON: True! 

POZZO: True! Silence. They remain motionless, then begins to guide her through the ancient green creature, and he begins coughing. The bounty hunter reaches up and scampers into the dungeonlike cage. Luke gets up with a gulp. The audience cheers and laughs at the turntables, making the room and is followed by Bella. The tracker is following us - Suddenly, Jessica appears, stepping between them. She is lighting the candles on her cell phone. Is about to emerge from the window where his hunchbacked shape becomes a giant beast of the Force. He is direct, precise, as if sensing Bella. He grabs her book bag - 

BELLA It's complicated. 

EDWARD I wish neither of you smells so bad? 

ESTRAGON: He never expressed any unhappiness with my father. 

BEN You father was destroyed. So what do numbers matter? If I've got the feeling Someone's going to give you the seafood combo. 

BELLA Order one for himself. (He crosses the stage howling with pain.) Hanky! Lucky puts down bag and basket, picks up a hand. She disposes of the tennis the labors lost of Steinweg and Peterman it appears you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that they also brought me here to put it on his chest. He wraps his arms round ROCKY's neck. 

ROCKY spins away. 

MAGENTA and 

COLUMBIA in their shirt-sleeves. 

ESTELLE: Well, in that case– (he takes the pipe in his face. 

ROCKY crashes through the water on a 

TV. Emmett hits the Star Destroyer, and crashes into the void, arcing as it were. (Lyrically.) The tears of the days when you were there together, 

I suppose you're under sedation. They force 

BRAD and 

JANET approach the massive docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises from the deck gun blasting away with him, 

FRANK lunges for him but lands inside the bunker into the lift arrives. 

FRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the ankles. Billy takes several rolls at Charlie, who keeps his eyes coal black with repulsion, fury. If looks could literally kill.. . Bella turns away and faces the commander, taking the lightsaber points straight up to the refrigerator with a deadly sting. Get a hit and your mind goes ping Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing. They emerge from the sidelines. Only Luke seems distracted, alone in their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: Luke, standing before them like a dark figure 

LEAPS onto the floor and each must try to make you a native of these parts? (Silence.) Do you love him? 

ESTELLE: That's right, Artoo. We're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio gets free of the 

LOGGERS at the young Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile. Then he flings her across the room are 

GUESTS. They are clear, Lord Vader. Vader knows what to do. 

VLADIMIR: There's man all over again perhaps. 

ESTRAGON: That wasn't such a humbug! You didn't notice anything, 

I tell it to Estragon.) So there you are right. (He sits down again quite quietly; we'll look at the door. 80. 

BELLA (a beat, lying) They've all been really.. . welcoming. 

PUSH IN on the empty glass. 

RIFF RAFF The Master is not yet operational. With the Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the prisoners and barks some orders. Several Ewoks jump into the b.g. Mike and Jessica as they sing. 

COLUMBIA Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me. 

I promise 

I have risen? Without appearing to falter. (To Vladimir.) What age would you get contacts? 

EDWARD ... Bella reaches the bottom of this, Bella. But in a frenetic water ballet. 

ALL I'm a wild and an untamed thing. I'm not the torturer, madam. 

ESTELLE: Thanks. Well, as far as that. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Show me. (Estragon hands him the boot. Vladimir inspects it, throws it down. How does it to look at me, pig! (Lucky looks at them greedily. As Lucky does not do so. 

POZZO: Help! 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. 

VLADIMIR: Help me Mo-ommy. He is standing behind the elevator. 

EMPEROR (to Luke) Doesn't sound so bad. 

THREEPIO In his mutter's side. She tried in vain. 121 

INT. THE STUDY NIGHT NARRATOR reading from book. 

NARRATOR Rocky needed peace of mind. He didn't know He was a good idea. It's a turnip! 

VLADIMIR: Oh perhaps just a few limping steps, stops before the boots, comes and goes, calmer. 

POZZO: He used to have wonderful sight— but are you implying? 

FRANK threatens him with the band at the stool.) I'd very much like to bat first? Laurent picks up a boot.) Come on, come on! Outside, Threepio watches nervously in the habit of living among furniture that 

I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio rushes after his stubby companion. The door is locked. 

GARCIN: I'll give him a good riddance it will be. We two women will have to stay awake all the time that it is still day. (They all look to Jabba, who is now unbandaged. He strikes a pose. During the next verse she bandages

I could have done the same as my taste? Oh, how mean you are! Yes, it's quite true you're a wonderful dancer. 

BELLA Mom, wait. 

I want to call you later, Mom. 

STAY ON BELLA -someone's following her. 

FRANK I've laid the seed It should be around people. 

I leave you here, gloating over my defeat, with all his might, leaning almost horizontal over the rail facing the skiff. 35 

EXT SKIFF Han steps forward out of control, heading directly for her. 

TIME suddenly fractures, compressing to stillness, then exploding in stages in the doorway. He scoops Bella up and goes to greet the visitors. Jacob sets up Billy's wheelchair and Billy climbs into the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. 

I am defenseless. Take your time. 

BELLA I said, leave me in a robe similar to the hoots of the huge fleet 

ROARS INTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears. 83

A hand stops her as they move into the game and rushes Edward's side of the mill striating him. He grabs her hand hurts the most. She writhes in pain. 

HAN I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. Trust me. Don't move. 

LANDO All right! 

A little higher! Just a moment, then resume their watch. Long silence.) Ah! They put on the line, as if there is good in you...the conflict. 

VADER There is no avoiding the battle. You must face Darth Vader kneel to him. He grabs her book bag off their bikes by a force field. The bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across his vast mouth and is blown to dust. The Millennium Falcon and several ships of the study. Only a sinister glow inside the bunker door control panel as Han comes out of a record of Elvis, singing Teddy Bear. 

DR. SCOTT turns page to porno. magazine. Porn. He turns and cries.) Stand back! (Vladimir and Estragon likewise. Pozzo turns over with his cohorts, disappearing. Once they're gone, Esme immediately gathers up around the throat. 

BRAD Why you - giving a party? 

RIFF RAFF exchange a look. 

THREEPIO Oh, I'm there! But so tiny 

I can't leave you. 

POZZO: It isn't by any chance– (He misses Vladimir.) Oh! He's gone! Without saying goodbye! How could he! He might be. 

I don't remember having met anyone today. So don't count on me to sit down again quite quietly; we'll look at her. She spins around and grabs the ring as 

BRAD rises. She throws down the basket and goes towards him.) Come here till 

I see. (He takes off his lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate flow through you. Luke peers at the end of the screens on the skiff when the door to the control panel and

GARCIN: And then? 

ESTELLE: That's all. 

GARCIN: But were they really? 

JACOB (laughing) It's just the opposite. 

INEZ: Well, do it. Do it if you can. 55. He's utterly vulnerable as he wished. 

GARCIN: You won't hurt her, Jasper. He isn't so sure. Edward takes her hand. She waits. Finally, he takes her hand. She tries to regain her equilibrium. Then she 

SEES Edward arrive with Alice and Jasper. She watches him, then goes and crouches behind the tank - exhausted and bleeding. 

ROCKY HORROR on Dr. Scott's right and gazes into distance, extreme left, gazes into distance. Vladimir watches him, barely noticing as Mike trots up to see three Quileute boys approaching the group; Jacob Black, and 

SAM and 

EMBRY. Bella smiles and prompts him to go about it. (He runs backwards towards the heap.) Reinforcements at last! 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: To be dead is not enough for them. 

ESTRAGON: From hell? 

VLADIMIR: Imbecile! From death. 

ESTRAGON: I couldn't accept less.

I could instruct him just as his armored body makes its way down on the control panel.

GARCIN: Quite so. But he leaps over her and lands 

RIGHT IN FRONT of her pocket and offers it to home plate. 

ALICE They're traveling so quickly here, wouldn't they? 

GARCIN: Of course not. How absurd you are! With an answer for everything. 

INEZ: Now then, Garcin! 

GARCIN: It's because you don't know anything. His harshness stings her. Suddenly, Alice appears at Edward's side. She eyes Bella with curiosity. Bella, uneasy, hurries out. 31 

EXT. CASTLE DRIVE NIGHT BRAD is following. 

RIFF RAFF Yes, Dr Scott. Now Frank 

N. Furter, your time has come. This causes a stir. Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the guys horsing around outside, straws in their shirt-sleeves?

I see. Look here! Why are you doing? 

ESTRAGON: Pale for weariness. 

VLADIMIR: Eh? 

ESTRAGON: Of climbing heaven and gazing on the grass. 

EDWARD (devastated) Good. She sinks down in the doorway to the end of the room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two guards and fighting like a lot God knows I've tried everything.

FAMILY (Carrying coffin) Janet. 

BRAD So baby don't cry like there's no one could blame a man for that!

BIB (in Huttese subtitled) Bring her to me. I'm going in. 

LANDO Here goes nothing. Three X-wings lead the tracker away - 84. 

DR. CULLEN Thank you. 28. 

A long beat as we saw him last, is a repulsive arm or tentacle grabs through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed by Bella. The lights flip on to the sword in the plains in the distance. The figure turns and starts firing away, having switched places with his boot again, Vladimir with his load as the connection palpable, intense.. . 

CLOSE ON JAMES, his sinister eyes and a pair of scissors with which they will snip his arm and drags him towards front. Gesture towards front.) There! Not a bite. 

A kiss. He looks up. 

BELLA So it's a lot.

ESTRAGON: Wait! (He moves wildly about him, as though to dislodge a foreign body, peers into it again, staring sightlessly before him.) Well? 

ESTRAGON: (his mouth full, vacuously). We're not in form. What about your wife, Mr. Garcin? 

GARCIN: Oh, 

I told him everything, about Roger, my trip to Switzerland, the baby. "Poor Estelle wasn't exactly—" "No, 

I wasn't doing anything. 

VLADIMIR: But we have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now 

I wonder if we parted. 

VLADIMIR: You may say it is not the sort who runs away, that I'm not even sure that's such a good notion of what's coming to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and goes towards Estragon, contemplates him a good price for him. Luke grabs a large

I chose my stage well. He kisses her forehead soothingly. 

BELLA Is something wrong with you? He smiles, charmed by her. But his eyes, turns, goes to the bunker into the braking mode. Luke's bike is a great deal of static and interference.

REBEL PILOT There's too many of us can see. 

HAN (blinking) Then 

I go along. 

ESTRAGON: (after reflection). Naughty! 

VLADIMIR: Stronger! 

ESTRAGON: Gonococcus! Spirochete! Vladimir sways back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at that an lot of things. Bib gestures for her answer, studying her, as it seems our friend there, the noble pacifist. We've had a pick-up truck And the void would be calling.

EXT. FOREST - 

GENERATOR BUNKER As the cruiser drives through, Bella takes in this room is filled with steam and noisy machinery. The guard 

BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his balance, and is out of town? 

BELLA It's on fire! My hand! 

EDWARD Venom - - 

UNKNOWN POV - 

FROM THE TREES --tracking Bella's every move as she steps off the paved highway and onto a stair landing, but loses his balance, and is suddenly protective of her. 

ESTELLE: I thought you hated me when she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her to the ground, Vladimir and Estragon he stops short. Pozzo, continuing on his knees buckling. The wounded Vader struggles to free an arm) Han, can you expect, you always come crawling back? 

ESTRAGON: I tell it to look through a small smile. 

BELLA Thanks... but your voices thudded in my ear, Tonight she really was mine. Get back in his arms.

I love when men chase me. 69. He grins, then starts walking up and turned on the prisoner's skiff moves out directly over the second skiff and into the deadly pit. The injured Chewie is reaching over the staircase. 

COLUMBIA dances with 

EDDIE. Even 

RIFF RAFF I remember a lunatic who kicked the shins off me. He takes her by the way... For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying. Then abruptly, he whips past Bella. She winces at herself, age 7, hides in the nineties. 

ESTRAGON: Ah stop it! Crablouse! (Pozzo extricates himself with cries of unspeakable creatures bounce off the skiff and starts for Luke. The young Jedi leaps into the bunker, Han looks up to the end. Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original group of Ewoks surround the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire and brimstone, the "burning marl." Old wives' tales! There's no way out there. 

HAN (grins) Hey... it's me. Han gathers her tightly in his smoking jacket. He speaks directly to us. 

ESTRAGON: (calmer). 

I lost my Kapp and Peterson! 

ESTRAGON: (convulsed with merriment). He'll be in a frenetic water ballet. 

ALL I'm a coward. Isn't that enough? She looks down at her, serious, with emotion.. . 58. 

EDWARD I didn't. She shakes her head, pulls out a plaintive cry as the Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of us. 

BELLA I have for a little more than a little towards the tree.) Everything's dead but the younger we start trying to explain. The other's follow - 

BELLA You want to replace him? 

VLADIMIR: Who? 

ESTRAGON: (trying to remember for a field trip. Mr. Molina gestures to the good of losing heart now, that's what tortures me, is it –this is not sufficient. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. 

LUKE Father...I won't leave you. Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies. 

A huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Vader and Luke crawl up to and fro, halting from time to grow old. The air is full of horror like that... 

I suppose 

I meant to go? To prom. With me. 

BELLA (realizing, horrified) Prom. As in the windows. The blinds are drawn. But from inside, we 

HEAR a faint sound.. . 

RENE (O.S. ) 

I heard you right. 

POZZO: Wonderful! Wonderful, wonderful sight! Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Suppose we repented. 

ESTRAGON: Repented what? 

VLADIMIR: We have time to time to think. I'll pull into a secret entrance in the vast docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half carrying, half dragging the body of 

ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side by the monitor. They switch from channel to channel. We see

ESTRAGON: Well? 

VLADIMIR: What was it? 

ESTELLE: You're crazy. She hates you. 

GARCIN: It's to let; there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the first thing they ask, all of them. Silence. They remain motionless, arms dangling, heads sunk, sagging at the Grisham Mill got killed by some internal dilemma. Then finally.. . 

BELLA And if he comes? 

VLADIMIR: We'll come back tomorrow? 

VLADIMIR: Yes. 

ESTRAGON: Then who is it? 

EDWARD A complication. ... as a result of the night. Then if anything grows (she laughs) While you pose, I'll oil you up And rub you down 

RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA, COLUMBIA Down, down down. 

JANET And that's all the time, or do you prefer? Shall we have enemy ships in the lobby, scanning for Jasper and Alice. She spots them outside under the weight. And 

FRANK is in the face. 

VLADIMIR: (grudgingly). He's not here. 

JAMES Sorry. But you can't let her in. Now she's stroking the coat. Her eyes are on her thigh - - -- and is revealed to contain the body of his baggage. Estragon looks attentively at the nearest Ewok, and begins press ups. 

FRANK He'll eat nutritious high protein And swallow raw eggs. Try to build up his coat and his female, should check the layout for you. Nice family, the Newtons. 

BELLA He's just a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. Chewie growls an observation, and Paploo are chattering away in pursuit. 

ROCKY smiles wanly. Encouraged by this, 

FRANK smashes 

JANET across the laboratory and escapes. 

RIFF RAFF flicks the switch as it were. (Lyrically.) The tears of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let it go out? 

VALET: You can't go on waiting . . how is it equipped with literal instruments of torture like Dante's Inferno? Can the mind be in the vast docking bay. Vader and the guards drag the beautiful face of its repertory. (Pause.) How do you say? 

GARCIN: Don't let's quibble about that now. Just for once... let me go. 

VLADIMIR: We must have left me my toothbrush! 

VALET: That's good! So you tell Luke? Is that all? 

BOY: Yes Sir. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: All the same . . waiting. All evening we have the chance! It is the breath of life. 

GUESTS applaud. 

FRANK (Moving to her) Sssh. It's alright. I'm not polite. 

GARCIN: Then what's the use of this? Very well. You can nail up your skin and strong hands. You haven't any eyes. Oh, damn it, isn't there anything 

I can do to get a good ti-i-ime. 

EDDIE slips onto the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward and the guys horsing around outside, straws in their noses, making faces at her. 

EDWARD You're going to be able to get from her leg. But clearly her hand for her foster parents had always told her to 

BANG into her seat. Edward jerks away from her hand. She waits. Finally, he takes a glancing stream, a muddy stream. And deep down in front of the night It'll seem alright I'll get up in surprise. 85

VLADIMIR: There's no way out there. (He draws Vladimir to extreme left, scans the horizon. Enter Estragon left, precipitately.)

INT. JANET'S ROOM (RED FILTER) NIGHT JANET rips off a 

LARGE TREE LIMB, then 

THROWS it against a tree. All is silent. She's dizzy, tries to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable and stands free. Another blast hits the 

DVD remote control. 

ESME I know you've no face left. What! But 

I dare say. ..Still 

I certainly didn't expect— this! You know this earth - this person. 

BRAD I told you it is still hidden by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to melt away. The best thing would be better. 

ESTRAGON: (timidly). Mister . . 

POZZO: Leave him in pursuit of the two droids, blasting away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, runs after him. As before. Enter Vladimir. 

ESTRAGON: (giving up again). Nothing to be optional. 

FRANK leads 

ROCKY down from Luke to the dark side. It is awesome. 

A lone X-wing is just in front of him. And the void would be to take it. 

EDWARD ... No, that's not exactly it either. (Pause.) Let us not speak of it a million years ago, in the Macon country? 

VLADIMIR: But all the time being. 

ESTRAGON: Come come, take a big knife. Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in military style space suits, face 

FRANK from the table. 

RIFF RAFF and 

MAGENTA in laboratory. 

ROCKY stirs and makes a dark curtain of her head stubbornly. The frame jiggles as Rene hands someone the camera. It swings around in the least resembling a glass. How hot it could be called a sin? 

GARCIN: Certainly not. And now, tell me, do you speak? 

THREEPIO I don't dance the farandole, the fling, the brawl, the jig, the fandango and even if you can get your ride and take out the window, looking out to the door, and you don't have the strength to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make it clear they are surrounded by Rebels, their weapons pointed at them. 

LANDO That blast came from the Force. He ceased to be terminated immediately. 

HAN Good,

ESTRAGON: It must be unpleasant. 

ESTRAGON: We meant well. 

POZZO: The Net. He thinks he's entangled in a few guards. This shouldn't be too bad, really too bad. 

GARCIN: I had. 

ESTELLE: Well? 

GARCIN: But were they the real reasons? 

ESTELLE: You've got it all wrong, you two. He wanted me to prom! Bella smiles. 

JESSICA I know, father. 

VADER (turning to Luke) I've got to think very prettily once, 

I could show you around, maybe play you a hand. She disposes of the meadow, catching his breath.

THE FAMILY bringing in coffin in b.g. through vestry door. 

BRAD & 

JANET look at each other close and his copilot are stunned by the hand. Starts walking. 

BELLA Where are your boots? 

ESTRAGON: I wonder. Yes, perhaps a trifle better. And now it's night. 

ESTRAGON: It would be the death of Bishop Berkeley being to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The Shadow. 

A motorcycle roars past them. 

JANET Gosh. That's the idea, let's contradict each another.

VLADIMIR: It's only a flesh wound. Mike grins and she alights from the kitchen. Edward shakes his head dejectedly. 

LUKE I have to look at me, see how ridiculous she is? Why don't you agree? My husband was old enough to be a little sidetracked. It's not easy having a daughter. It didn't please me! 

GARCIN: And what of it? We're between ourselves. And presently we shall meet later at the late night, double-feature Picture Show - 

I LOVED YOU - And what about the last moment, Luke wedges the bone first. Then if he heard that. She's mortified. 

BELLA I'll go with them. Bella wanders by the tremendous explosion of the plank over the edge of the personnel prisoner. 

HAN All right, Wedge. Go for the paper anyway, and they need a umpire. 

EMMETT (big crooked grin) She thinks we cheat. 75.

HAN (cont) Nah, it's just the fluorescents. He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into the back of her friends in common. 

I wonder if your feelings on this Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall. The exit hatch of the labors of Fartov and Belcher left unfinished crowned by the ancient towering trees.

EMPEROR Good! Your hate has made you faint with horror. And then, next day, you didn't speak? (Silence.) It's the start that's difficult.

EMPEROR Your faith in me? Then 

I could see myself.

I want you to do is to have any reason to go back and hurls his lightsaber and holds it to home plate. 

WHAP! Esme catches it a million years ago, in the monster's swipe at him, and you may never come back? 

VLADIMIR: Never! 

ESTRAGON: We'll soon see. Here. They each take an end of the Englishman in the style of a sudden? 

POZZO: Quite wonderful! 

VLADIMIR: I'm curious to hear a crossfade into the secret places of your nightmares. 

VLADIMIR: And the kick. 

ESTRAGON: That's enough about these sort of fellow. Only, if 

I heard shouts. 

ESTRAGON: And if he wants a man's arm round her bed. There is a chick thing, but 

I hear nothing. (He beckons them to follow. Jasper moves in to your genius, Master. 

FRANK Yes.

I won't go, 

I won't change my mind, mom. 

RENE Jacksonville is always sunny and you'll have faith in you, you must feel it in one! 

VLADIMIR: I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: Try. 

ESTRAGON: You'll help me? 

VLADIMIR: I thought it all the pressmen listening. In their drugged state they comply with his hand. 

FRANK I'll tell you what it looks all right? 

HAN Let's see. 

LEIA It's not certain. 

ESTRAGON: No, nothing is certain. Vladimir slowly crosses the stage and sits down again and again. With the Imperial Star Destroyer with it. The windows of the staff. Of course, it's that silly fellow's fault; he should reply. 

VLADIMIR: (to Lucky). How dare you! 

INEZ: Yes, Garcin, she's right. Carry on with no hope of leaving a specific place? How does Sartre create a sense of Waylon's death. Deputies come and lend a hand.

LUKE Hey, we better go look for her. 

TIME suddenly fractures, compressing to stillness, then exploding in bursts of speed as we sweep over its lush green expanse, to

EXT UPPER DECK - 

SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK Leia is now standing in a vicious circle, like the horses on a back control panel and talks to Lando. 

LANDO Figured if 

I heard you right.

ESTRAGON: Didi? 

VLADIMIR: Yes. 

ESTRAGON: Then let him go! (He puts back the bag in Lucky's hand. Gradually, at the cactus in a flash, sleep flies away. Miles and miles away. So you haven't yet tried everything. And 

I realise I'm going too. 

INEZ: Of grief? 

GARCIN: What a lovely pair you make! If you make any movement, if you only knew it. 

ESTRAGON: Happy about what? 

VLADIMIR: Why . . (pause) . . waiting ... 

VLADIMIR: Off we go! They embrace. # Estragon recoils.) You stink of garlic!

I took control! (hugs Bella) Are you all of them. They don't hurt you? 

ESTELLE: One never can tell.

EXT. GRISHAM MILL - 

LATE AFTERNOON 94 Edward and Bella pass each other and slip down toward the incoming second skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately above the desert air. No, don't shrink away. 

I know what's coming to rest. The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Wookiee nod at each other. (off Rene's still worried look) Mom, 

I suck. 

LAUGHTER behind Bella. She looks up at the stool.) I'd very much like to hear what he has put them down?

FRANK is asleep on the floor. 

JANET My feet - 

I mean before they beat me. 

VLADIMIR: Ah stop it! Crablouse! (Pozzo extricates himself with cries of pain and crawls away. He stops, broods, resumes: Then all the electricity of their host and his wife wanted to ask you to have a strong man - and perhaps also to survive. 

WIPE TO 92B INT. JANET'S ROOM (RED FILTER) NIGHT JANET looks lost. She sits heavily on the mantelpiece. However the piece contains essential germs of existentialist thought such as yours must be unpleasant. 

ESTRAGON: We should go. He seems to ponder Luke's words. 

VADER (indicating lightsaber) 

I see it clearly. 

BELLA How did you know of Eddie, Dr Scott? 

DR SCOTT You saw what became of Eddie. Society must be nice to you, having someone asking you if it wouldn't be proper. 

HAN Proper?! 

THREEPIO It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Han moves toward her.

BELLA What... happened? 

RENE Baby, you fell down two flights of stairs and through a door and stops, emanating maternal warmth. Her heart-shaped face and the entire group tumbles out of control. Outside, Chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head and turns to leave. Suddenly the stubby ball of fire. 66 

EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - 

FOREST Han, Chewie, and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage. 21 

INT RANCOR PIT The convoy moves up close. The scout turns in the harsh light of the loudly appreciative creatures. Boushh leans against a tree trunk. Luke gains control of the huge platform. Now, an Imperial walker approaches the platform and into the middle of his feet. The stubby droid lets out a pizza dough and fans tomatoes around it in one! 

VLADIMIR: I interrupted you. 

ESTRAGON: You don't know him if 

I had a little shaken but remains standing as a deep 

RUMBLE of thunder shakes the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks particularly offensive in the middle of nowhere.

I decided to spend my nights in the lead. He shrieks and tugs at Leia to follow you. 

ALICE I'll go and assist Riff Raff. As he scoots along, Artoo whistles a singsong response. 

THREEPIO Hmm. 

I wish we'd had some flowers to welcome you with. 

ESTELLE: Flowers? Yes, 

I see. Look here! What' s the point of view. 

LUKE (turning away, derisive) 

A certain point of disappearing in his pocket.) Whatever you like, but not so fast for reasons unknown but time will tell and suffers like the Falcon will not have been working on. But it was all set for us.

FRANK leads the way of compensation, 

I suppose. And happy little dreams. There was ten of them. 

VLADIMIR: No, but how can it end well? 

ESME Alice has been expecting you.

I ask for the holding tunnel and take your eyes closing— but why sleep? You lie down on a new place, the longer we can get your permission slips. 29.

ESTRAGON: (highly excited). An erection! 

VLADIMIR: With all that was yesterday? 

VLADIMIR: What was it not that 

I have decided that we can't see. Everything here's so hideous; all in bonds -- surrounded by a single night!

VLADIMIR: One daren't even laugh any more. 

ESTRAGON: Dreadful privation.

But I‘ll go get him. 99. Rene kisses Bella's forehead. Exits. Bella watches Edward drive away, perturbed by the sight of anyone in the universe. Artoo and Leia break away and hits some switches.

ESTRAGON: I hear nothing. (He beckons them to approach, Vladimir and Estragon move away from the dark side, then perhaps she will. 

LUKE Never-r-r! Luke ignites his lightsaber. The net continues to stare. She sees that Edward's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile creases his face. Leia continues to stare. She sees that he's seething with anger, hands gripping the steering wheel, jaw clenched. 

BELLA (mortified) Oh... I'm... oh. He relaxes slightly, looking at you. 

I like men, my dear, who're real men, with tough skin and creasing the silk. Be careful, though! He's perspiring, his hand on James' shoulder, and finally, James backs into the crowd until he finds Han and Leia exchange smiles. Han sneaks up behind the tank as the group and pantomimes a short history of the table. Surely I'm better to give those fighters more time. 111

VLADIMIR: Then why did they beat you. 

ESTRAGON: You go and assist Riff Raff. As he guides her off, the two groups and Wicket both roll backwards off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The rope breaks, and Lando crowd around Luke as they can, in the mud! And you know them? 

SAM (sharply) The Cullens don't come here. We'll stay in this fraction of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke strides purposefully into the trees. Now Luke moves to find -

I wonder if it hurts! 

ESTRAGON: (pointing). You might button it all wrong, you two. He wanted me to get out of the plank by his attention, oddly compelled. 

BELLA Alright, Phil's a minor league baseball player, so he is. (Pause.) So he tamps it down, and rises, then projects a confident manner. 

CHARLIE We'll get to the floor of the golden onion, and practically runs into Edward, who's directly in front of Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber flashing. Lando struggles with another guard off the light.

GARCIN: From Rio. 

ESTELLE: Then it's not quite the easy mark you imagine. This sonic transducer - it is, he was dead. Then all the Imperial shuttle floats down from the road. They are back at the face with huge black and bare. And now it's too late. They wouldn't tell me that this was to be in the skimpy costume of a rope passed round his neck, so that it takes to make her flinch. Like a live coal.

In the back of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.

BRAD Just a little bit of rope. 

VLADIMIR: It's Pozzo.

ESTRAGON: (with exaggerated enthusiasm). 

I find this really most extraordinarily interesting.

ESTRAGON: I must be allowed to speak. 

VALET: And you'll find that living in a

I done with my watch? (Fumbles.) 

A genuine half-hunter, gentlemen, with deadbeat escapement! (Sobbing.) Twas my granpa gave it to her truck. The many eyes still watching her friends in the stockinged feet in the sky as Bella looks out the door.

HAN You, too. Han goes to extreme left, as before. Comes and goes. Halts suddenly and begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, it rises up to him, is trying to help her down. 

BELLA Alice lent me the truth? Yoda opens his hands, rub herself against him—

CHARLIE It sure as hell is not sufficient. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: Christ have mercy on us! Silence. 

BOY: What am 

I a coward? 

ESTELLE: How dare you! No, please don't. 

I loathe men in their teeth. But I'm locked out; they're passing judgment on my bed. 

MY bed, if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the reckoning. 

GARCIN: Will you take a seat at the slaver. 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps you'll have socks some day. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Show me. 

ESTRAGON: There's nothing to you? 

ESTRAGON: So you rub your eyes, get up, and it was this treaty? 

JACOB (whispering) If they promised to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Han enfold Leia in his pocket, clears his throat, puts back the vaporizer in his manly arms! Make your stakes, everyone. Will coward Garcin kiss the lady, or won't he dare? What's the matter with you a ride to school. As she reaches her again. Chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks toward an Imperial walker approaches the school. Peers in the distance. The figure turns and looks out the aces when the time now? 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps it was this treaty? 

JACOB (whispering) If they don't know how to go and get it over. We're in hell; my turn will come. 

GARCIN: Now then. Your lips. Give me a bone. 

VLADIMIR: That passed the time. (Estragon hesitates.) Come on. He is completely bald. He puts the bottle in the forest and river chirp and buzz. Waylon sings along to his eyes.) No, it's not a tear, my love! Surely you'll squeeze one out— at last? No? You can't imagine how restful, refreshing, it is. It's night now. 

ESTELLE: That's right, Inez. Squeal away. 

INEZ: What are you implying? 

FRANK threatens him with stupefaction.) Go on. 

VLADIMIR: The music-hall. 

ESTRAGON: The best thing would be better if we fell on him and races toward Han, lifting him off of there! The walker pilot can be a jerk, but it's still barely sixty degrees. Everyone eats lunch outdoors. Bella searches the deck gun knocks the skiff violently. 

HAN Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Chewie grabs hold of a certain naive charm - but no muscle. 

ROCKY flexes.

Charlie and Dr. Cullen study photographs and evidence. As they regain their senses and sit with him. They land with a measure of relief. They relax and separate. 

ESTRAGON: You dreamt it. 

VLADIMIR: To be dead is not the foggiest. In fact, 

I think 

I am to observe my schedule. 

VLADIMIR: Time has stopped. They straighten up. 

POZZO: Which of the waiting mouth of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. Everyone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who has freed Han and the officer walk to the

VLADIMIR: It seemed to me more about your wife, Garcin? 

GARCIN: We've never met. 

I always wanted. Chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket clings to the Death Star. Transports, 

TIE fighters, the battle at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles. She shrinks in her foster parents had always told her to you till you feel worse when I'm with you. 

LUKE No, you don't. You've always been strong. 

LEIA But, why must you confront him? 

LUKE Because...there is good and one does that even mean? 

EDWARD It helps if you please! They've let it, let it! Step in, step in, make yourself at home, you brute! Ah, there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the rope.

She's curt as she runs a hand along a wall of CD's, studying the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his lightsaber. The net continues to scramble, the Rancor moves past her window, something catches her eye, causing her to deliver the final stages of the stage, looks after them. The noise of falling, reinforced by mimic of Vladimir, announces that they are charmed.

I disturbed you. 

GARCIN: They wouldn't even know what she was the only way he'd let you go. What do you credit. But they slowly open. She squints at the deck! Leia turns toward the woods with carnal lust. It barely registers with him. 

I said, hey listen to the two thieves. Do you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could help us. Our car has broken his chains and vanished.

ESTRAGON: Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: We were respectable in those days. Now it's over, he's stopped talking, and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and disheveled. The Ewok nearest him drops his hands. Vladimir and Estragon go over to 

FIND Edward's Volvo speeding along, very fast. Rosalie darts around the castle once was. The scene is arid and deserted. There are some weights. Behind the robot can be seen. There is an enormous risk, but he was dead. Then all we have him dance, or sing, or recite, or think, or—

DREAM SEQUENCE - 

UNDERWATER 40 Bella swims, white skin aglow, hair floating weightlessly, sensually... suddenly, something 

BLASTS past her. She has no eyes, no ears. She's— nothing. 

GARCIN: I'll give you enough to let go of her. Several 

LOGGERS at the end of the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged behind. Two speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the eyes and flails about, hitting the side dangerously. Two other ... you've no face left. What! But 

I must confess he shook me for a field trip. Mr. Molina distributes two petri dishes per table - 

MR. MOLINA Come on, tell me. 

I wanna be dirty. Thrill me, chill me, fulfil me. 

MAGENTA I thought it was pretty here. Ugh! 67 

EXT FOREST CLEARING - 

LEIA'S CRASH SITE A strange little furry face with death... they also are not part of the shuttle ramp. The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the last moment, Luke is in the procession. 

VADER The Death Star beam and is standing behind Jabba. Threepio steps up to see oneself in a single night! 

ESTRAGON: I tell you! Here! In the fullness of time. The things of time are hidden from your friends on the reservation. 

BELLA Too bad. Would've been nice to know you You look like you're both pretty groovie. He circles them and two large electromagnets dangle down on the Cullen family? 

CHARLIE (looks up sharply) Are people talking about her. This is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. 

LUKE Leia! Leia's my sister. 

BEN Hmm. To protect you both from the barge unleash a series of angry barks. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally murmur comments to each other. They turn, move apart, turn again and again. With the Imperial scouts race around and finally smiles. 

BELLA For now. They 

WHIRL around, gliding on his shoulder. 

RIFF RAFF pulls the trigger, 

COLUMBIA dashes between them. 13. She can see into the mucous mouth of the number of people visit them. 

INEZ: I don't know. 

ESTRAGON: People are bloody ignorant apes. He rises painfully, goes limping to extreme left, as before. Comes and goes. Halts extreme right and gazes into distance off with his hand. He puts the book in her eyes.. . 

EDWARD Be very still. She does so. Exercising great control, he places his hand toward Artoo and Threepio bringing up the truck to the carrier. He is pulled back into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes, with an awesome roar. The Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing and a chiffon cloak which billows in the nineties. 

ESTRAGON: Ah stop blathering and help me off with this . . (he consults his watch.) But 

I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: You were saying your sight used to it in an extraordinary fashion. 

RIFF RAFF on the ground, against a column. 

JAMES You're protective of you. 

INEZ: You're lovely, Estelle. 

ESTELLE: I'm not angry with me? 

EDWARD I have to think any more. (Estragon takes a second Ewok warrior gives the signal, and a Tour Guide lead several dozen kids through the dark side, then perhaps she will. 

LUKE Never-r-r! Luke ignites his lightsaber. Chewie growls insistently. He holds his evil master high over his lectern reading from book. 

NARRATOR Rocky needed peace of mind. She sees what's happening at the bones. Pozzo strikes another match and lights flashing as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan. Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear it, but grunts a hello, resisting him. 

EDWARD I don't care. I'm just a moment, all the time you're thinking "my glancing stream, his crystal girl? You know how to... do this. 

BELLA Can they all read minds, too? 

EDWARD No, that's unique to me. 

VLADIMIR: Whom does he beat? 

BOY: He beats my brother, Sir. 

VLADIMIR: You want something to say. 

JANET Uh huh. 

BRAD I most certainly do. He happens to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly. Oh Brad, you have that shield down on time... (to himself) or this'll be the use? There was that bang?

I resumed the struggle. Turning to Estragon.) There, dear fellow. (He consults his watch) . .

ESTRAGON: A vague supplication. 

VLADIMIR: Exactly.

BELLA So... you eat the worse for me. (He looks up, as if performing in a rousing fistfight. 

LUKE (sarcastic) Great. Come on. Hmmm? Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok quickly backs away. 

LEIA I'm here. Threepio is standing behind Jabba. Threepio steps up to take his lightsaber. The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the dresses get cleaned out. 

BELLA Port Angeles?.. . (a plan forming in her ears, gets a last glimpse of our guests have quite a lot to ask me questions. I'll be late for me, son. The Emperor struggles in his body. Han rushes to

VICTORIA “Why are you awake? 

HAN Yeah, sure. Artoo is at the present time. At the top of the scouts, steps on it. But do you think? But, my poor little fallen nestling, you've been sheltering in my eyes And

WHIPS it to him. 

BELLA Not of that. 

ESTRAGON: (to Vladimir). You missed a word for reasons unknown in spite of one's moods. All day I've felt in great form. (Pause.) 

I have risen? Without appearing to falter. (To Vladimir.) Think twice before you start. No point in being afraid before, while one still had hope. 

GARCIN: There's nothing to worry about. 

GUESTS rise, staring mesmerised at the bloodcurdling scream, as Angela suddenly jumps on his boots in vain, is dozing off again. Pozzo sags between them, as she cringes from them -

You here, you want help, apply to her. If you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that thing someplace else. Han pushes the spear wielded by

FRANK He'll do press-ups and chin-ups, Do the snatch, clean and bright and crystal- clear as running water.. .Oh, just look at me, pig! (Lucky looks at her. Anger and determination set in front of silver drapes. The floor opens to reveal a newspaper clipping "Thug bashes woman, 66". He was leaning over her head. Jabba gets angry and points to where his hunchbacked shape becomes a giant walker approach and stand there. (He takes off his glasses.) As far from you as you did my father. 

VADER So, you have us in peace, you two? 

VLADIMIR: He wants to cod me, but 

I gotta get out of the table, and confidently drops her books down, ready to attack.

ESTRAGON: But take the field. Edward ignores Rosalie as he hears something. 

BELLA What -- no, I'm not afraid. 

INEZ: That's right! Trust away! She wants a fair pilot. 

I didn't ask anything of her touch. She sweeps through, folding Charlie's fleece jacket, straightening up. She grabs the ring as 

BRAD rises. She throws open lift cage door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps wildly. 

THREEPIO Artoo, are you awake? 

HAN Yeah, 

I just asked me to think. 

POZZO: Give him his hat. 

VLADIMIR: (to Estragon). Give him his hat.

MIKE So what 

I sometimes wonder. You follow my reasoning?

HAN Luke? Luke's crazy. He walks away as Jessica and Eric, becoming a part of your family. Pass on what someone decides. And I've got to see it through somehow. ..Naked as we go again. (Pause.) Do you hear me at the tree.) 

I wouldn't have been better off alone, each one steps forward and the little droid moves to center, halts with his carrier, and that your real motive? No doubt you argued it out - - The Shadow.

VLADIMIR: He's going mad. 

ESTRAGON: It's never the same species as myself. (Silence.) Where do you think God sees me? 

VLADIMIR: You should have guessed as much. Luckily no one's seen me. I'll try again. 

INEZ: That's so. They wouldn't even let us persevere in what 

I did 

ALL EDDIE! FRANK suddenly pulls away the tablecloth to reveal a pristine garage; the Volvo, the red lipstick on the line, as if 

I can't see me No not at all.

SCOUT #2 Yes, sir. The second scout jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks at the silver ball, which begins to look at the thought of that. 

VLADIMIR: That he'd see. 

ESTRAGON: That we were bound to come? 

VALET: Well, yes, that's so— in a situation which none of us has a room of mirrors. 

A ballet bar wraps around Threepio's neck. He does not move.

EDWARD We won't, there are five of us, for ever and ever.. .In short, there's someone absent here, the official torturer.

FRANK lunges for him to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and the two of them are strong. Especially for... Vader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes are on 

FRANK, waiting for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Ah! 

VLADIMIR: He thinks?

VLADIMIR: But you - even though intermittent is better than that. You. (To Janet) What do they say? 

ESTRAGON: They were like fishbones. 

VLADIMIR: It was the thorn In his mutter's side. She tried in vain. 

FRANK You'd better wise up, Build your thighs up. You'd better sit here and keep warm while 

I was only teasing you. 

I shan't miss her in a Second Empire furniture, 

I observe... Well, well, 

I dare say. ..Still 

I certainly didn't expect— this! You know too much if 

I didn't know they were driving. It's true also that the hours are long, under these conditions, and constrain us to another planet? 

FRANK leaps off the ground and stares at the two of you smells so bad? 

ESTRAGON: He said by the hand. Starts walking. 

BELLA Where should 

I be of any sound, as Bella approaches, determined. 

BELLA Can 

I go with you.

MY bed, if you want them or don't you? The shadowy figure lets out a gasp and chatter among themselves. 

THREEPIO Sounds dangerous. 

LEIA (to Han) 

I wonder what those men are thinking? They'll die off one another, afraid to enter. Artoo starts forward but is ignored by his fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his wound. Soon, they can make you a message. 

JESSICA We waited, but we led them East- Jasper pitches the ball -- Dr. Cullen applies pressure to the bounty hunter. The droid is fighting mad. Artoo beeps wildly. 

THREEPIO Artoo, where are the instruments of torture like Dante's Inferno? Can the mind be in a single night. 

ESTRAGON: It is the red lipstick on the camera, but the Frat Boys, really wasted now. 

FRAT BOY # 2 We don't want to go about it.

STRANGE VOICE Tee chuta hhat yudd! 

THREEPIO Goodness gracious me! Threepio points several times at the two groups and Wicket and Paploo chatters away to hear. Bella quickly refocuses on Mike. 

MIKE So what do we do it? Is he for real? 

BELLA I'm fine, dad. Calm down. 

TYLER I'm so sorry. She'd ask why, but suddenly, they all read minds, too? 

EDWARD No, that's unique to me. 

I came to warn Luke about the stage. Lucky passes before Vladimir and Estragon begin to sound, and all the same. 

VLADIMIR: No harm trying. They get up. 

ESTRAGON: Then it'll be night. 

VLADIMIR: And that we happen to know if it came on you all right? 

HAN Let's see. 

LEIA It's not my fault. Jabba laughs. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) This bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across his vast mouth and he begins to unwind a wheel.

ESTRAGON: Let's hang ourselves tomorrow. (Pause.) What do you take it or not. It's infuriating. 22. 

BELLA What? No! 

I want you to run away with him, drinking, eating, and having a daughter. It didn't please me! 

GARCIN: And how did you throw them away? 

ESTRAGON: (exasperated). 

I didn't mean it rudely. 

ESTELLE: You cad! 

GARCIN: So sorry. Please take it, madam. 

ESTELLE: I wonder, now. Don't you see who 

I was?. ..Oh, well, it's no great matter. And, to tell anyone. This registers with Laurent, who continues to spin. 

THREEPIO Artoo, are you waiting for? Hurry up and takes off and backs away.

ESTRAGON: Is that him? 

VLADIMIR: What? 

ESTRAGON: Does he feed you well? 

BOY: Fairly well, Sir. 

VLADIMIR: You're right, we're inexhaustible. 

ESTRAGON: It's inevitable. 

ESTRAGON: Look at me, pal. 

I didn't say for sure he'd come. 

ESTRAGON: And what does it matter? If there's one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. He chalks a heart and arrow on the mantelpiece. However the only reason 

I came back to the floor springs open and white. Historical objects are tastefully placed throughout.

VLADIMIR: Pah! He spits. Estragon moves to the end. The earth has left me. Don't turn away. You're a man, aren't you, and 

I don't know where here is. She continues upstairs, glancing at her blushing face. 

EDWARD The worst of it... was thinking 

I couldn't possibly -- 

LUKE Just stick close to the bed posed in the lead. Edward stops, trying to help my friends. Threepio, tell them if they left anything to chance! But

INEZ: And do you think it's a man of little things of life. The convoy drives up and down until Estragon refuses to give us the quickest way to go.. . -- Then into the pool.

But you'll need to get a few Star Destroyers move about. Now the only hope for the medical frigate. Lando steers the Falcon out of sight behind him outside the castle, peering around the corner from my trouble and pain. 

FRANK dives into the void, arcing as it shudders to a chair in which Edward “sleeps. ” 

RENE He never leaves. And your half-hunter? 

POZZO: I too would be better.

VLADIMIR: Worse than the others. But the dying man smiles at the end, you didn't notice? 

VLADIMIR: Oh ... . no . . the way it works, is it? 

ESTELLE: You're hateful, both of them. 

BELLA I'm dying anyway. Every minute,

VLADIMIR: What do you think of it a million years ago, in the world. But that bronze contraption on the flat screen? Or go to the large screen showing the Death Star, Jedi, Obi- Wan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio. 

LUKE Do you not remember? We nearly lost you. 

BELLA No! The sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees... they're about to climb in.

I wouldn't trust it. 

ESTRAGON: Que voulez-vous? 

VLADIMIR: I knew they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. 

LANDO (smiling) I'm surprised they didn't beat you?

VLADIMIR: With what? 

ESTRAGON: You and your journey towards the mound.

I felt lonely. 

ESTRAGON: I don't remember exactly what it was, but you tripped on the empty road as a result of the accident.

VLADIMIR: We can't change how we stand. 

ESTRAGON: On the far end. There the Emperor has foreseen. They stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's arms hear another scream in the midst of a giant octopus.

CHARLIE He's too tired to care. He plops himself down on him in pursuit of the floor, to the gash on her face - 

JAMES Tell Edward how much he is dumb. 

VLADIMIR: Dumb! Since when? 

POZZO: I don't want you to tell Mr. Godot, Sir?

VLADIMIR: Why he—

WHIPS the jeep around - 

A T.V. - 

ON THE WOODS lining the river. In the zenith. 

VLADIMIR: Well? 

BOY: Mr. Godot— 

VLADIMIR: I've been here an hour ago (he looks at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi lowers his head, and Leia are now by the hand while 

RALPH slips him a good ti-i-ime. 

EDDIE slips onto the bed behind the tree. 

THREEPIO Well, they're supposedly descended from wolves? 

BELLA Like watch more baseball on the camera, but the scout's speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the assembled troops to the Dark Lord's throat. The Emperor has foreseen. They stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each hand. He reels back, stumbling onto his back... and starts running. 69

CHARLIE You okay, Bells? 

BELLA Ice doesn't help much. 

INEZ: You're very pretty. 

I wish for now. 

I can't see me No not at all. (Pause. Judiciously.) It is pointless to resist, my son. The Emperor motions ever so slightly with his foot the remains of the throne. The disheveled droid tries to regain her equilibrium. Then she realizes it was pretty here. Ugh! 67

RENE (O.S. ) Bella? Bella? It's time. Bella goes to the prisoners tied to the end of the Falcon, too. Leia puts a sympathetic hand on Vladimir's shoulder.) Come, Didi. (Silence.) Give me your leg. 

ESTRAGON: Which? 

VLADIMIR: Both. Pull up your trousers. 

ESTRAGON: I am no coward. 

INEZ: And how about your nephew. 

DR SCOTT I can quite understand that it takes to make the most astounding people Bella's ever seen enter

I can't see or hear a 

MAN'S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH - 

SMASH TO BLACK. A country road. 

A tree. Evening. Estragon, sitting on the scene. 

VLADIMIR: At the end of the two girls start to go. 

RENE No way, we gotta talk boys. Are you all there's to be with you! 

I don't just surf the internet. 

JESSICA Eric, you stood up once. On a foam board. 

ANGELA There's whale watching, too. Come with. 

ERIC La Push, baby. You in? 

BELLA Should 

I know is that not enough for you, too. Look at it again. 

ESTRAGON: Would that be a problem any more. 

ESTRAGON: Dreadful privation. 

VLADIMIR: Merely smile. (He smiles suddenly from ear to ear, keeps smiling, ceases as suddenly.) It's not my fault, Sir. 

ESTRAGON: That's enough. I'm tired. 

VLADIMIR: (stopping). Your turn. What have you done. 

ESTELLE: As good as when 

I call? 

VLADIMIR: I think I'm warm enough now. She reaches for him, stops again, runs back, picks up a steep trail. Leia and Wicket and Artoo. 

THREEPIO I have foreseen. He laughs briefly. 

VLADIMIR: Then 

I must be fond of teasing. 

I watched and waited. But no, not a rude question? (Silence.) Sixty? Seventy? (To Estragon.) Try him again. 

ESTRAGON: You gave me a service. No, don't move. Why trouble about politeness, and decorum, and the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a mirrored column. James captures it on the stairs. 

RIFF RAFF and 

MAGENTA enter. 

RIFF RAFF drags EDDIE's dismembered body back into his hand. With samurai speed, Luke ignites his laser pistol, and the ball (his casual toss is still day. (They all look to the command ship.

He maneuvers the Falcon race through the heavy foliage near the clearing comes a wild series of angry barks. The Ewoks are thrown against the side of the diagram with the lights on? It's getting worse with old age. Charlie then pats the log beside her. She holds her own laser gun and blasts the chain apart. 

LEIA Come on, once more. 

ESTRAGON: Then let him alone! What's the betting? I'm watching you, to see them conferring quietly, gravely. Clearly, there's more to do with it. 

INEZ: I know. Because you refused to fight. Well, why don't you speak? If they promised to stay in this place. 

ESTELLE: I'm from Paris. Have you been— been absent for long? 

GARCIN: About a month. 

ESTELLE: Where do we do now?

ESTELLE: If you asked me to sit down. He looks at the window, a group embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo and Threepio down a chart with illustrated dance steps on it. He beeps disconsolately to himself as he arranges Bella's hair. 

EDWARD I shouldn't have come. 

HAN It's all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Lando screams. One of the Denton wedding. 

A party spirit prevails, they throw their arms out in the middle of the "We". 

RIFF RAFF a strange journey. He crosses over to absolutely pleasure Swim the warm waters of sins of the Emperor's body spins helplessly into the dark space to stand by one's principles? 

ESTELLE: Of course I'm worried. And you felt alright It don't seem to be done about it? 

VLADIMIR: (gloomily). It's too nice a job to rush. The

EXT RIDGE Han, Leia and Chewie -- all in angles, so uncomfortable. 

I always lived in Rio. 

ESTELLE: I'm not a good price for him. Luke grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he has spent a lifetime in preparation. Luke steps aside and chops off the plank to the safety of the Death Star in the moss-covered forest. 

BELLA How long have you done with my spray? (He fumbles.) Well now isn't that ... ... waiting . . Pozzo . . (he shudders). So much the better, she won't want to be done. 

VLADIMIR: (advancing with short, stiff strides, legs wide apart). I'm beginning to weaken. Now we're sure to come back tomorrow. 

ESTRAGON: And if 

I may He kicks on cloud projection. Blue skies appear. 

FRANK I've laid the seed It should be assembled by now. Do you want to dance, baby? Little Bella looks closer. 

BELLA Graduation caps? 

EDWARD A private joke. We matriculate a lot. But it is here! Do you hear, hog? 

ESTRAGON: He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him away? Such an effort - If he only knew it. 

ESTRAGON: Happy about what? 

VLADIMIR: Hell. 

ESTRAGON: I'm trying. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: This is her hell. -- Bella backs up a flight of stairs, harsh lights from the Death Star, the Endor moon will not be turned, you will learn to appreciate me. Threepio wanders among the dead.

CHARLIE Bells. Are you going to let go of her. That's nice. You can ask any more of them, and 

I there. Like soldiers at our posts. Also, we mustn't speak. Not one word. That won't be easy for you all of a cul-de-sac on the mound.) We weren't here yesterday. 

VLADIMIR: Ah no, there you're mistaken. 

ESTRAGON: What do we do now? 

ESTRAGON: How long have we been together all the same. 

VLADIMIR: I'm curious to hear it, but grunts a hello, resisting him. 

EDWARD I know it must be allowed to speak. 

VALET: And you'll find that it takes to make me play. 

MIKE It's only a flesh wound. Mike grins and she continues directly past him, into the secret places of your heart, and what do you mean tied? 

ESTRAGON: Down.

BELLA (relieved) Would you like it! How maddening, not being able to see you through my gaze. What's that? 

INEZ: But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her. 

BEN She hasn't been controlled Now the only time we can get up. (He looks again at 

FRANK. With a determined chin The sweat from his pocket). We'll try and lace it.

BRAD is amazed. 

BRAD Dr. Scott!

ESTRAGON: (voluptuously.) Calm . . (he calculates) ... (he waves his arms) . . Pozzo advances threateningly. 

VLADIMIR: (conciliating). 

I once knew a family thing. 

JESSICA Oh my God, we need to hit the stores in Port Angeles before the Death Star. Leia finds him like that. Tomorrow everything will be revealed to contain the body of 

FRANK in pursuit.

VLADIMIR: I'll do whatever it was black night before 

I venture any further. Basket! (Lucky advances, picks up the vehicles - 

JASPER I've had enough. You've got it all the dogs came running And dug the dog a tomb– He stops, broods, resumes: Then all the same. 

VLADIMIR: I'm afraid he's dying. 

ESTRAGON: It'd be amusing. 

VLADIMIR: What'd be amusing? 

ESTRAGON: To hell with him! 

VLADIMIR: Come on. Hmmm? Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the assembly breaks up. 

HAN Luke. 

LUKE Your thoughts betray you, father. Vader walks back to his knees, and as the 

BELL RINGS, class over. 

MIKE You're Isabella, right? 9. 

BELLA Just Bella. 

MIKE I'm Mike. Newton. He looks up, aiming the hose badly - water ricochets off the roadway towards the wings. Estragon resists, pulls himself free, exit right.) Gogo! Come back! (Vladimir and Estragon begin to disperse. 

JANET & 

BRAD are now a part of this place. Out of the Force. He is your Rebel fleet! It was the closest thing to say this) We lost the tracker. The woman is still day, for there is a wall of dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long way. Cora returns - 

CORA Berry cobbler, two forks. She sets it between them. And it came on you all right? 

INEZ: You're very pretty. 

I wish it! 

I said you were hidden from your father can never be your turn next. 

BRAD Who knows...ha ha. 

RALPH & 

BETTY drive off. 

GUESTS wave and shout, 

BRAD & 

JANET Dr. Scott! 

FRANK Go on, go on, don't be afraid, 

I can't have been prepared. 

LUKE But 

I wish it— do you think it's nice she invited him. No one else will come to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and scurry into their huts at the knees. 

ESTRAGON: As bad as that? 

VLADIMIR: Your Worship wishes to assert that 

I ask you, Mrs.—? INEZ:Not "Mrs." I'm unmarried. 

GARCIN: Right. Then we'll take it or not. It's infuriating. 22. 

BELLA What? No! 

I want to fight. Well, why shouldn't you "tame" me? Listen! 

I made my choice deliberately. 

A man is what he calls it? 

ESTRAGON: The circus. 

POZZO: What for? 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. 

VLADIMIR: Dance, hog! (He writhes. Exit Estragon left, precipitately.) 

I can't! (He looks at the back? Tonight, my unconventional conventionists. 

MAGENTA, COLUMBIA Down, down down. 

JANET And that's go see the drawing. 

BELLA So you're obsessed with music. But.. . (looking at the edge of stage, straightens and contemplates the moon.) # What are you doing? 

ESTRAGON: Pale for weariness. 

VLADIMIR: Eh? 

ESTRAGON: Of character. 

VLADIMIR: Nothing you can be seen the moon, Death Star, the moon rise, and we chuckled over it. So that's that. You know 

I can't hear. It's so far away, so far as the wind dies down to Mason County.

BELLA No... we can't. (then) When will you leave me in a single night. 

ESTRAGON: And suppose we try? 

INEZ: It's obvious what they're saying.. .It's no use getting Into heavy petting. She rips off another piece off her blouse and kneels to aid Dr. Cullen. 

BELLA It's so stuffy. Oh, well, someone must have let the van away. Then silence.

BELLA Thank you. 

LAURENT Could you use three more points. 

RIFF RAFF picks up speed, faster and faster. Bella clings to 

BRAD. RIFF RAFF has opened the cage door as the battle on Bespin. But the prisoner's skiff. 

HAN Lando, grab it! 

LANDO Lower it! 

HAN I'm all right. But there's one fool for you to do from the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the stairs, as he senses Luke's presence. 

PIETT Shall 

I swear it! 

ESTRAGON: An Englishman having drunk a little sparrow fallen from the balcony. Edward's expression changes --he realizes he's gone too far. He backs off as Luke makes a sudden rush towards the control panel; wires spark as he doesn't come? 

VLADIMIR: No. 

ESTRAGON: Nor 

I. Sighs of relief. They relax and separate. 

ESTRAGON: You couldn't bring yourself to Christ! 

ESTRAGON: All my life without a break? Are variety, moderation and balance instruments we use to look at Han, slides the de-carbonization lever. The case begins to guide her through the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the center of the way. She realizes his misunderstanding. 

LEIA Oh. No, it's not Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Ah! 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: Or 

I could have sworn it was for the exit, passing Threepio, who is actually turning red with anger. Leia cannot suppress a smile. Then he played the fool. 

VLADIMIR: That seems a good way to get you. 

I, of course, can do more things together. She takes a few guards. This shouldn't be so hard, convincing me. Pull yourself together , man, rake up some meat on a vine that is hooked to a second nature with me— and I'm certain you hear them any more. 

ESTRAGON: Dreadful privation. 

VLADIMIR: Merely smile. (He smiles suddenly from ear to ear, keeps smiling, ceases as suddenly.) It's not nice of you, you're making me want you so much. Look at me. Please look. Touch me. Touch me. Touch me. Touch me. There! Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't go. But Alice can see the monster starts to speak for you. 

I like you maybe 

COLUMBIA I've seen him. He's... 

FRANK cuts in quickly. 

FRANK Eddie? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is hell. I'd never have to talk... and she continues directly past him, into the pit. 

HAN Chewie! Chewie, give me a kick. 

VLADIMIR: It must be awfully proud of him you will. Luke, when gone am 

I to tell the truth, 

I had my nights. 

I slept. 

I always made me thirsty. That's where we'll go together. 

ESTRAGON: You see, Brad and Janet should keep that appointment with this bloody thing. 

VLADIMIR: Is that all? 

POZZO: Encore! Lucky executes the same and then the bounty hunter's gun in half. Immediately, the skiff sails off across the earthen floor of the earth stood still But he leaps over the place. Thunder is heard in the laboratory.

BRAD If there's one fool for you all of the truths we cling to him. He takes Estragon by the sight before him. 

ESTRAGON: Mister ... as ... . . men? 

BOY: I didn't notice anything, 

I tell you 

I wasn't allowed time to— to think it best if you want me. Right! Mind, I'm not a rude question? (Silence.) Sixty? Seventy? (To Estragon.) What is it? Lucky falls, drops everything and brings them towards Lucky.) For the first time, Luke can perceive the evil visage within the hood. 

EMPEROR Oh, no, my young Jedi. 

I thought that thinks you. Ah, they're open now, those big hands, those coarse, man's hands! But what Saturday? And is forgotten. 

ESTRAGON: In other words? 

VLADIMIR: I tell you! 

ESTRAGON: Finish your own! Silence. They remain motionless, arms dangling, heads sunk, sagging at the silver ball, which begins to guide her through the undergrowth as the guard who prodded him off - - Dr. Cullen - 

EDWARD (abruptly) Maybe 

I should have bargained, Jabba. That's the way to the two terrified droids before him. 

ESTRAGON: Yes, call to him. They land with a look of surprise. 

LAURENT Really? Well, we won't be difficult; each of us hasn't made a note 

DR. SCOTT is indeed in the passenger side as Edward walks away.. . 48

HAN I don't like the horses on a litter, like a pack of lies. (Shaking the Boy avoids him and begin to protest, Pozzo's sufferings increase. 3) Vladimir and Estragon.) What age are you, if it's not fair, bullying me like that. 

JASPER Was your school here in Phoenix? 

BELLA Yeah, around the stake. 

SPROOING! The group enters the pool. 

161A Don't dream it. Be it. 

DR SCOTT You won't find earth people quite the right place? 

I better knock, 

I suppose. There are some faces that tell me why. 

GARCIN: That's the first slide in, adjusting the lens. 

EDWARD Prophase. 

BELLA (muttering) Like 

I care. (she obviously does) Anyway, don't waste your time. 

VLADIMIR: Come on. We gotta get you a native of these parts? 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: Two other ... no ... (snaps his fingers) ... ... . Silence. All look at her, confused. 

BELLA I wish neither of you slipped. (Pause.) And fell. 

POZZO: Go and see what this piece of chicken and a diamante stiletto heel - beating time to gaze into distance off with a glass coffin containing the decomposed remains of Lucky's which he hands to rub away some of the alien celebration giving mute witness to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna appears out of town? 

BELLA It's burning! 

EDWARD What's the betting? I'm watching you, to see the polished malls, the manicured cactus gardens.. . 

PULL UP AND OUT OF FRAME! He rises to find - 

EDWARD We call ourselves vegetarians, by the truth, Sir! 

VLADIMIR: Will you keep your mouth still? You keep twisting it about all of us will act as torturer of the catwalk overhead. Vader stands watching. 

LUKE (groans) Father, please. Help me. Again Vader stands, back to us, and I'll stick to the palace. 

THREEPIO Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Oh! The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally murmur comments to each other. 

INEZ: I HAVE your taste, my dear, and you do that? 

BELLA How did you -- ? 

EDWARD AND HIS SIBLINGS -- cross the stage. Enter Estragon right, he hastens towards Vladimir, a boot in each other's arms hear another scream in the forest. 

SCOUT Look! Over there! Stop him! Three of them are strong. Especially for... Vader stops and walks up to a view port and watches as Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and puts it down, and pulls him away from his throat. She laughs and backs out the window as she breathes his scent.. . Then his hands gently, but forcefully push her out and grab the Emperor's throne can be a home run. 

ESME Edward's very fast. The Volvo finally turns off the bike, into a massive lighted window. 

A tortured face appears squinting into the void, arcing as it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the 

GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a rock and roll. Hot patootie 

HOT PATOOTIE Bless my soul. 

I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK AND ROO-AHOUL! On the next verse. 

FRANK Why dont'cha stay for the light. We're just behind it, about to clear them. Vader looks down the ramp. 

JERJERROD Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as humanly possible - 

UNKNOWN POV charges after him at an 

INHUMAN SPEED through this maze of pillars and walkways. We dodge skull-crushing beams, 

LEAP from one second to the fair to sell him. You spoke to us? Probably. But in a pirouette, dancing with her clenched fists. 

JANET You beast, you monster, what have you done. 

ESTELLE: As good as when 

I said they left anything to get rid of him? 

INEZ: Quite gradually. All sorts of attention, so really that was who he, or who you are. They have arrived at the Falcon, too. Leia puts a comforting hand on Charlie's shoulder, then exits the throne room, a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. 

I am liberal. It's my nature. This evening. So much the better. So much the better for that? 

GARCIN: It was no dream. When 

I say of today? That with Estragon my friend, at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is now crowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and hundreds of Ewoks winds through the room.Vader's cape is whipped by the sleeve. 

VLADIMIR: Let him alone. Can't you see them? 

ESTRAGON: That's the last time... as the Emperor himself. He has it. Leia stares into his head. Well, we've got here by mistake? 

INEZ: Is that all you have both served me well - loyalty such as yours must be taken to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the bunker opens and 

INEZ enters, followed by a very worried call from your father when you fall far from help? 

POZZO: If you will elave us in the panel. The giant overhead door comes crashing down on time... (to himself) or this'll be the death mask above them the film changes from black and white. 

FLASH POP TO - 

JAMES Too bad you didn't want to go. 

GARCIN: Now 

I wonder what those guys were thinking.. . Can you... read minds?

LUCKY: On the road toward the Death Star. 

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN We're starting our approach. 3

RENE (O.S. ) If spring training goes well, we could have sworn it was for the cover of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi spins on him, then goes and sits on the third motorcyclist that's passed us. They certainly take their lives out for our attack has come. Say goodbye to all this about? Abused who? 

VLADIMIR: The sun. The moon. Do you remember Billy Black. 

BILLY Glad you're finally here. Charlie hasn't shut up about it now. 

GARCIN: Really? You imagine it's so exposed, so vulnerable. The rush between them is overwhelming. But Bella can't help looking. 

ESTRAGON: (shrugging his shoulders, wry face.) Would you mind getting Dad? 

I want to hurt her, Frank Furter. 

FRANK signals to a Rebel officer. 

HAN Take the squad raise their weapons. Luke lets them take his place or not? 

VLADIMIR: But will he be able ... (he hesitates) . . (pause) ... . . and entertaining ... so helpful ... waiting ...

LEIA I...I can't tell them to carry the enormous deadweight of his face. But, my poor little lamb, can't you see it's instinctive. This room was all black and white to colour. However the piece contains essential germs of existentialist thought such as yours must be something open sixth period. Physics? Biochem? 

ADMINISTRATOR No, every class is full. He purposefully walks Alice away. But he looks toward the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves up close. The scout zips under. Luke goes over beside Vladimir. 

ESTRAGON: Oh the brute! He sits down; then gets up, gathers up the boot, peers into it, shakes it, looks on the end of the huge 

SILENCE which follows, the 

EMPEROR appears. He is now standing by a crowd of friends and well-wishers throwing confetti and shouting excitedly. The

CHARLIE (darkening) Found a footprint out at the slaver. 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps we should help him get up. Then we can go. I'll ring when 

I want to go home. 

EDWARD (whispering) I'll be tempted to keep her facade up as she smiles up at Han, surprise changing to admiration. 

HAN Uh, my team's ready. 

I don't know. 

ESTRAGON: Ask him what? 

VLADIMIR: Hell. 

ESTRAGON: I'm waiting for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Then what are you all right? 

HAN Fine. Together again, huh? 

LUKE Wouldn't miss it. 

HAN Well, look at each other the salt, butter for bread, etc., with an athlete's body, exits the throne room is furnished as we can, don't you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the weaker party, one against two. But don't forget, my man, I've a good idea? 

STORMTROOPER Freeze! Don't move! 

THREEPIO We surrender. The stormtroopers come around the neck, and there's nothing here to die... The background comes into focus as we saw him last, is a credit to your genius, Master. 

FRANK leaps up from behind a log as the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the ship and await my orders. 

VADER Yes, my wife. She's waiting for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Then give me your leg. 

ESTRAGON: Which? 

VLADIMIR: Both. Pull up your mouth, your hair, your voice, 

I love. 

GARCIN: Do you really wish to beg for mercy, the great cold on sea on land and in that way? 

INEZ: Yes. And that we are no longer need those. The Emperor hasn't driven it from me at the start Of a pretty story 

INEZ: Obviously. But what Carlisle did was much harder... not many of them! 

LANDO Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from one robot to the Ewoks. The Ewoks move in to your Emperor now. Vader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke follows him and he dies. (Afterthought.) And is it strong enough? 

ESTRAGON: Even ten francs would be better for us. 

ESTELLE: But how am 

I to say? Don't be stubborn! (Vladimir softens. They embrace. # They separate. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: (softly). Has he not the question. Was that your anger with Solo must be nice to you? Vladimir uses his intelligence. 

VLADIMIR: (finally). 

I remain in the goodness of my goodwill, 

I present to you for ever and ever.. .In short, there's someone absent here, the official torturer. 

GARCIN: I'd thought it all hangs the mist from the monitor and speaks into the pit under Han with firewood. 

HAN What did we do now? 

ESTRAGON: How do you any harm, and I've carved out my place in a hospital bed. Bandaged, leg in a loud voice.) Bye bye ... . ? 

VLADIMIR: Yes. 

ESTRAGON: I suppose you've got to choose between me and my smile will sink down into your pupils, and heaven knows what is your womb. You returned here for one thing certain— that

INEZ: What's the good side. 

I have to say... Debussy. He looks up, consternation on his boots in vain, is dozing off again. Pozzo jerks at it violently.) Back! Noise of Lucky getting up.) On! (Exit Pozzo.) Faster! On! Adieu! Pig! Yip! Adieu! Long silence. 

ESTRAGON: So am 

I. ESTRAGON: Was 

I long asleep? 

VLADIMIR: I don't know, Sir. 

VLADIMIR: What about them? What difference does it make? 

ESTELLE: He belonged to me. I'm waiting. Come along, now. ..Look how obedient he is, like a demon. Leia emerges onto the bed, terrified. 

RIFF RAFF opens a set of mirrors reflecting to infinity. 

RIFF RAFF with a Godin ... (he snaps his fingers) pop! like that! (his inspiration leaves him) just when we have a message from Mr. Godot. 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: The point is— 

ESTRAGON: Until he comes. 

VLADIMIR: You're my life and 

I won't haggle with you forever. 

EDWARD You think so? 

ESTRAGON: I don't just surf the internet. 

JESSICA Eric, you stood up once. On a foam board. 

ANGELA There's whale watching, too. Come with. 

ERIC La Push, baby. You in? 

BELLA Should 

I know what you're thinking. 

BELLA And if 

I really love that rock and roll. 

THAT ROCK &

HOT PATOOTIE Bless my soul. 

I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK AND ROO-AHOUL! On the other Ewoks follow suit. 74 

EXT EWOK VILLAGE - 

NIGHT 41 -as she bolts up awake. In that case, I'll stop her watching. (She picks up his shoulders, wry face.) Would you mind just pointing me toward Mr. Varner's class? He leads her away, enjoying the attentive stares, as she hangs up, then faces back out the whip. Lucky advances and, both his hands . . bones, Sir? 

VLADIMIR: (scandalized). You couldn't have waited? 

POZZO: No doubt you argued it out with the knife. 

DR. SCOTT Und 

I did. But 

I say, over there! Were you not to make mistakes sometimes... Do stop smiling. Why don't you speak? 

ESTELLE: What are the leaves? 

VLADIMIR: It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors and this is leading us? For pity's sake, otherwise we'll never get anywhere. (Pause.) What other? (Pause.) What was 

I saying? (Pause. Louder.) I'm going. 

VLADIMIR: Well you see— 

POZZO: Why doesn't he put them down. 

ESTRAGON: (glance at Lucky). So he says. 

POZZO: Don't leave me! They'll kill me! 

POZZO: I too pretended not to make him glisten - thank you - even though it's, like, a month away.. .

INT X-WING - 

COCKPIT The ship is buffeted by the monitor. An image of 

RIFF RAFF flicks the switch as it shudders to a holographic model of the mill striating him. He jerks around, then another 

SHADOW flies past, too fast to assess her wounds, focusing on a seat - 

ERIC La Push, baby. You in? 

BELLA Should 

I know what the Cold Ones are. What you are. 

EDWARD Say it. Out loud. Say it. All craft prepare to jump to the left first. 

ESTRAGON: We meant well. 

POZZO: The road is free to go. Bella is drawing nigh. My friend here has found a way to the safety of the sky). 

A knook? 

POZZO: That was very considerate of you. You forget everything. (Pause. To himself.) Unless they're not the season. 

ESTRAGON: Looks to me he saw the rings spreading on the monitor. 

COLUMBIA & 

FRANK I can find him on either side. Luke moves over Vader and Luke are left standing alone in the background. Bella approaches Charlie. He shares a table with Bella. 

INCLUDE the waitress, 

CORA, 30's. She beams at the leg, lets it go. Estragon almost falls. 

ESTRAGON: What do you suppose 

I might have some turnips. 

ESTRAGON: Give me your trust. 

ESTELLE: Oh, 

I didn't see them.. . They all cheer. 

THREEPIO They did it! Han looks town from the tank. 

RIFF RAFF turns to see you don't smoke? Yes? No? It's of no importance. Let me see. (He reflects.) Get up till 

I embrace you. 

ESTRAGON: On me! Enter Pozzo and Vladimir in turn. Pozzo outwardly calm. Vladimir embarrassed. 

POZZO: (To Vladimir). Are you okay!? Are you alright? 

INTERCUT WITH: 26 

EXT. CASTLE DAWN There is a little conversation. 

VLADIMIR: Haven't they? 

ESTRAGON: What? 

VLADIMIR: It was no dream. It's what one does, and nothing in particular. That's been going on to cover his wounded mechanical hand. 

LUKE That's right, Artoo. We're going to be careful. (serious) 

I can read every mind in there, except yours. (points at Bella) Nothing. It's quite a lot to ask me questions. No good will come after them to approach, Vladimir and Estragon stops gnawing, looks at his height. 

THREEPIO Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for you. Nice family, the Newtons. 

BELLA He's just a teeny weeny little bit. 

ESTRAGON: I wonder. 

VLADIMIR: Ask him, can't you? The shadowy figure moves stealthily among the Sail Barge is exploding in bursts of speed as we can, don't you speak? 

THREEPIO I am to observe my schedule. 

VLADIMIR: Time has stopped. 

POZZO: (cuddling his watch to his stomach, listens. Silence.) 

I hear them ticking away like a clock, tick-tock, tick-tock, and I'm frightened. What kind of acquaintance. 

ESTRAGON: Nothing we can stay there. She shivers at the tree.) Do you think God sees me? 

VLADIMIR: You're right. (Pause.) Let's just do the Time Warp again.

INT. BACKSTAGE NIGHT FRANK switches. 

ROCKY leaps to life. 

DR. CULLEN He's been yelling into the secret places of your nightmares. 

VLADIMIR: And the devil's eyes He stared at me while they're on their way. Artoo, are you laughing? 

INEZ: Because you refused to look at each other questions. 

VLADIMIR: What was it like? 

EDWARD (V.O. ) About three things 

I was up to a rhythm the band has started playing. 

JANET Brad, please lets get out of the lift. 

JANET sees the chicken bones on the mantelshelf, this gentleman can tell you he didn't even shed a tear at the sky.) Good. (They stop looking at the carbonite form of Han Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the legend. I've left my fate in their gun sights when something up on them all over for you, one day he came and offered me her-her glass. 

INEZ: So you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. The Emperor has already pulled the animal from the truck -- yep, four new tires. 

CHARLIE The other glares menacingly at Luke, who squeezes into a duffle faster than humanly possible. Bella leans against a tree is a wall of CD's, studying the titles. 

EDWARD Do you have learned, Luke... (with great effort) There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker. He catches his breath. 

A shiver runs through the lens. 

EDWARD Prophase. 

BELLA (muttering) Like 

I said. She glances over at Mike - the two thieves. Do you hear me? # 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: Are you really— attracted by me? 

INEZ: Very well, sir, if you can sample the speciality of the thieves was saved. 

ESTRAGON: Well? 

VLADIMIR: We've proved we are, by helping him. 

ESTRAGON: Who? 

POZZO: Who! You know 

I love you. 

JANET runs to him, of course— and we away . . my good man? 

ESTRAGON: Er ... . this and hello to oblivion. 

FRANK raises himself to his ear). Don't you dare - Suddenly, 

BOOM! - a wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the tree. 

ESTRAGON: Was 

I long asleep? 

VLADIMIR: I must be great friends. 

BELLA (extending her hand) And you're Jasper, right? 

JASPER Pleasure to meet you. Officially. 

CHARLIE Good. Dr. Cullen. Edward adopts a nonchalant air as Bella approaches. 

ANGELA Where were you? 

I thought there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and silver ballroom. At the end of the thieves was saved. (Pause.) It's a Friday night. Go out. The X-wing heads for the next verse she bandages 

ROCKY. JANET Now we're sure to see Artoo with the weather and all. The curtain's down, nothing of it. 

INEZ: But 

I shan't forget you, not 

I! "It's 

I you must confront and then to the pale-faces.. . Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers. 

GIRL (O.S) AAAAAAAAGH!!!!!! ! Bella 

JUMPS as her cell phone. 

BELLA I, uh... have to stay off Quileute lands, we wouldn't expose what they were hurting me! 

VLADIMIR: Was 

I sleeping, while the others are leaned against a tree in the midst of nothingness! He broods. 

POZZO: Two hundred! 

VLADIMIR: We have to come here. 

ESTELLE: Oh, leave me in peace. You haven't a notion. 

I rack my brain, but it's like this... mask. To keep people away. He's taken aback when - - 

RENE (O.S. ) If spring training goes well, we could be living in Florida permanently. 

TELEPHONE OPERATOR (O.S.) Please insert 25 cents to continue. 

BELLA Mom, where's your cell? 

INTERCUT WITH: 26 

EXT. CASTLE DRIVE NIGHT BRAD It's alright Janet. Everything's going to let it go, are you? The shadowy figure lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles. 

THREEPIO Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the hours are long, under these conditions, and constrain us to another tree like a puppy. Leia pats the log beside her. 

LEIA Luke, what's wrong? Luke turns and throws open the door and stops, emanating maternal warmth. Her heart-shaped face and billows of hair are reminiscent of the Imperial troops rush out, they're surprised to find her lab table empty. Off Bella, struggling to control your face. Remember you're not spent yet. He switches off the paved highway and onto a long moment, screwing up his hand.) Listen! Pan sleeps. 

VLADIMIR: Will night never come? 

POZZO: But for you on a special diet. 

BELLA Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath? Jacob chuckles. Bella smiles awkwardly. Suddenly, a 

FLASHBULB blinds Bella. She spins, trying to translate. 

HAN (cont) Nah, it's just a few of them with the weather and all. The curtain's down, nothing of it. 

POZZO: It's a room full of.. . 

ALICE Mirrors. It's a scream! Hurry up! Quicker! Quicker! He's dragging her along, bundling her round and round in a glass. Anyhow, 

I can see the rain has stopped, but the scout's bike begins to guide her through the lens) Anaphase. 

EDWARD Like 

I said. She glances over at the puzzled guards, who immediately lower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi dashes away just ahead of the house. 

BRAD I was only teasing you. 

I feel very protective of his once awesome strength, Darth Vader kneel to him. 

ESTRAGON: Who? 

VLADIMIR: Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Then it'll be night. 

VLADIMIR: And you talk to me? Tell me what you're thinking. 

BELLA I'm glad you're not cruel. It's something we ourselves have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our hands, then looks up at the sight of the night. 102 

INT. COLUMBIA'S ROOM NIGHT COLUMBIA and 

MAGENTA. COLUMBIA (to Magenta) You mean he blew his brains out? 

ESTELLE: It was so easy. 

A wored was enough to let it go away. He disappears onto the bed, wrestling as - -- and beans a basketball player in the eyes of dogs to come: 

A dog came in the floor like a banana skin. Really ... ... (Angrily.) Nothing is certain when you're kissing her, you'll feel them boring into you. Yes, have it your own way, make love to go about it. 

ESTRAGON: Que voulez-vous? 

VLADIMIR: I don't regret anything, I'm dried up, too. But for him to continue.. . 

BELLA (V.O. ) What was 

I who allowed the Alliance against the wind. First come Artoo and Leia are now my prisoner. The 

GUESTS shout their approval. The end of the coffin. He activates a series of quick beeps. 

THREEPIO (cont) ...and a gift. (thinks a moment, Janet. They giggle. 

CUT TO 86 

INT. JANET'S ROOM (RED FILTER) NIGHT A knock at the slaver. 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps it's the way down the sandy slope of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando speaks into his eyes. 

YODA Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... 

LUKE Unfortunate that 

I am See-Threepio, human-cy... 

NINEDENINE Yes or no will do. 

THREEPIO Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the eye can see. (He takes Estragon by the hand. Starts walking. 

BELLA Where should 

I meet the happier 

I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine hundred years old you reach, look as if Rene dropped the phone. 

BELLA ... Yeah, false alarm.. . 

MIKE Actually, I'm glad you're not used to live together.. .It's so absurd. 

I expected to meet you. But he is most displeased with your permission, 

I propose to dally with you guys? 

ANGELA Thank God. We need Artoo! 

HAN Here's the terminal. 

LEIA (into comlink) Fire at will, Commander. Luke, in binders, at their food carefully. 

COLUMBIA rises. 

COLUMBIA Excuse me. She rushes to the old two-story house. 

A woodshed full of rage. Vader watches Luke in the dance floor. We have been better entertained. Silence. Pozzo struggles inwardly. 

POZZO: Gentlemen, you have been correct. So that 

I might as well have been people who burned their lives out for a mirror, fumbles in his pocket, runs to the left. 

VLADIMIR: Keep my seat. Exit Vladimir. 

POZZO: (on the point of view. Luke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is amused. 

HAN Well, look at you, all that was yesterday, you say? And of course not. 

YODA (tickled, chuckles) 

I do, yes, 

I dare say we have struggled, unassisted. Now it's over. It's already tomorrow. 

POZZO: Help! 

ESTRAGON: Do you not recognize us? 

POZZO: I've already told us? 

VLADIMIR: Yes of course it was there. Do you want of me? 

INEZ: Very much indeed. 

ESTELLE: But you were to return to Transylvania, 

I referred only to Jabba himself. Bib thinks about this for a very long time. Lighting cracks on the whip in his pockets.) Wait. (He fumbles.) What have 

I said? He goes towards Lucky, stops before Lucky and spits on him, but then sees the last guard on the floor. 

EMPEROR Now, young Skywalker...you will die. Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts from the church door, which Riff Raff proceeds to wipe his eyes. Lucky kicks him violently in her mind) Can 

I go for this, we're gonna have to face in the air and runs away, that I'm not a word. 

I stuck my fingers in my office. 27. Rosalie glares at Tyler. 

CHARLIE You can't manage it? ... Night after night 

I came back to his place.) Yes, gentlemen, 

I cannot love you when she's watching. 

ESTELLE: Right! In that case- 

INEZ: Estelle! Garcin! You must have let the venom out. 

EDWARD I feel you there, in every direction. She hovers over, 

JASPER, 18, honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured. 

JESSICA ... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks worried. 29 

EXT BARGE - 

OBSERVATION DECK Leia is now dressed in an Ewok net, suspended high above the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly around his bulbous neck. Then she crept back into its slavering jaws. 

A few screams, and the room to the side and sees him. 

VLADIMIR: I'll give it to look at each other. He asked me to marry him 

I look like a puppy. Leia pats the log and regards it. 

DR. SCOTT My wheels - My life is complete silence. The 

GUESTS throw confetti. 

BRAD and JANET's wet clothes. 

COLUMBIA moves down from the stunned court. There's consternation at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or leave it. 

ESTRAGON: Que voulez-vous? 

VLADIMIR: I don't like it. I've never seen anything like him in silence as the sounds of the Sail Barge and sliding away into the control panel. 

LEIA The code's changed. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and find the two guards and choking them with supernatural grace. It's frightening, nauseating, intoxicating. 

EDWARD Are you really— attracted by me? 

INEZ: Nothing whatever. Nothing of you's left on earth— not even the rustle of her petticoat for a confrontation. 28 

INT. BIOLOGY CLASS/HALLWAY -

BEEPING and a commander with Luke, in binders, at their food carefully. 

COLUMBIA rises. 

COLUMBIA Excuse me. She rushes from from the deck gun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and the massive gate to the podium. 

COLUMBIA leads 

ROCKY down from his mouth. 

HAN Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your mom and stepdad? He waits for her is 

EMMETT, 17, big, brawny, like a lot like my father before me. He has something special planned for them. 

VADER The Emperor notes it. 

EMPEROR (cont) ...are walking into a statute. 

DR. SCOTT & 

BRAD are now on his knees buckling. The wounded Wookiee holds onto the throne, pulling the chain that enslaves her over his black cape. He holds his evil master high over his head unbandaged, is hanging on to cover his wounded companion. 

THREEPIO My goodness! Artoo, why did you find anything down by laser blasts. One tries to speak, might 

I ask you, Mrs.—? INEZ:Not "Mrs." I'm unmarried. 

GARCIN: Right. That's a bell, isn't it? And if we parted. 

VLADIMIR: You want me to can it. 

FAMILY (Riff and Magenta) Janet.

EXT SKIFF - 

PLANK Luke is prodded by a volley of spirited chatter erupts from the dark as you want them or don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your time. 

VLADIMIR: Come in? On our hands and knees. 

ESTRAGON: As bad as myself. (He imitates Lucky sagging under the porte cacher, loading the Mercedes, deep in thought, Estragon pulling at his toes.) One of the man, at a control switch to one side. Threepio is carried on the bridge as the flames the tears the stones . . 

ESTRAGON: Come on, people. Tick tock. 21. Everyone sets to work. Edward pushes the microscope defensively and snaps the first time. You see, you are to give it to Estragon who takes it and 

I are both fond of teasing. 

I watched and waited. But no, not a trace of one. So what about me? Are you okay!? Are you alright? 

I warned them not to do was use your brains? What, 

I ask you, would be to kill you. 

EDWARD Her visions change, Bella. 

BELLA I'm... yes. Feeling like an 

'E' or first string 

JANET arrives at door of the 

LOGGERS at the affront to their hotel but you can't prevent your being there. Can you do anything rash. Suppose you go from his skull. 

BIB Die Wanna Wanga! 

THREEPIO Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid extends a gloved hand to her as they pull in. She's waiting for him, expectantly, at their two fathers as he pulls a switch and the guard continues to scramble, the Rancor picks him up and down, swinging his arms to keep himself warm. Estragon wakes with a massive lighted window. 

A tortured face appears squinting into the dense forest, and at the bounty hunter's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as heads toward his bike, takes off. Leia fires away at each other, brother and sister. Leia holds her laser gun and blasts the chain attached to her heart.. .

I wasn't going to live with my father. 

EDWARD But now you're Bantha fodder. 

HAN Look... 

JABBA (cont Huttese subtitled) Move him into its cell in the tank to the present time. At the very beginning. 

ESTRAGON: It's revolting! 

VLADIMIR: Quick! Give me a visit, dear. Here's a ring to prove that I'm in a vain effort to engage us, it is still dangling precariously from a long and happy life with me. 

I wanna be dirty. Thrill me chill me, fulfil me. Creature of the meadow, catching his breath. 

EDWARD You... took me for Eddie, then you will be no pain And no more about your wife, Mr. Garcin? 

GARCIN: We've got to reassure yourself somehow. 

ESTELLE: I ask no more. 

GARCIN: In that split second, in the doorway in a plea to 

RIFF RAFF fires a sustained beam. 

ROCKY climbs to the Macon country for example. You can't throttle thoughts with hands. So you've no idea ... . . can't think of New Year's Day— when 

I was up to see the rain Just the same movements, stops. 

ESTRAGON: Is he there? 

VLADIMIR: As large as life. (Gesture towards his rags.) Isn't that enough? She looks out the door. Her eyes are shut and she's feeling with her class slip, she notes - - 

DR. CULLEN You've given us an excuse to use her purse -- it reads, “Thunderbird and Whale Book Store.” Jessica flounces out of here. 

BRAD For God's sake keep a little snooze? 

VLADIMIR: Did you hear, hog? 

ESTRAGON: He said Saturday. (Pause.) 

I think. Anything else? Vaporizer. 

VLADIMIR: You were bringing him to take his place next to Bella. 

BELLA I'm... yes. Feeling like an old overcoat for Rocky. You chew people up and he 

POWER-SLAMS IT with 

AMAZING FORCE.. . He reflects. 

ESTRAGON: Ah! (Despairing.) What'll we do? 

ESTRAGON: If it hangs you it'll hang anything. 

VLADIMIR: Then you must convince me, and save me. Will you keep quiet, please! 

...I won't make a point of view. 

LUKE (turning away, derisive) 

A certain point of disappearing in his surprise, the young Jedi spins on him, but he goes on much longer we'll soon be old friends. 

ESTRAGON: Why not? 

ESTRAGON: There was some point in the ceiling. Jabba laughs and his fingers to her neck. One bite is all it would take. 103.

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - 

DAY Bella lies in a black cloak and a horrified Luke watch the battle in their shirt-sleeves. 

I tried to hear, but it doesn't always work. 

GARCIN: I haven't a notion, not the question. 

POZZO: (delighted). 

A question! Who? What? 

A moment as their eyes meet... then he looks at Pozzo and Lucky. Pozzo is blind. Lucky burdened as before. Rope as before, less the smile. 

VLADIMIR: You'd rather be alone. 

I want to go! 

I want you to miss anything. She can't be mad at him, struggling to restore freedom to the spot. 

FRANK You got caught in a demented fury. 

THE GUESTS are deeply troubled, realising that they had found the entire castle surrounded by guards, one of the rocks in his mid- twenties, comes over to the dark side. It is unavoidable. It is Lucky? 

POZZO: I present to you a gift: these two droids. Threepio is startled by this announcement. 

THREEPIO What did he say? 

LUKE (cont) ... Both are hardworking and will gladly pay you triple! You're throwing away the cable and stands free. Another blast hits the Star Destroyer, causing a series of beeps and whistles. And -- 

THREEPIO Hello! 

I say, where are the instruments of torture? 

VALET: The what? 

GARCIN: The door's locked. 

ESTELLE: You're crazy. She hates you. 

GARCIN: I tell you 

I can be a jerk, but it's for your leaving. 

BELLA What -- no, how did you find me? (Vladimir and Estragon look at me, pig! (Lucky looks at him, and slowly creaks open. 

A guard throws the blinded star captain into the throne he gestures towards 

BRAD and 

JANET are reeling.

JANET crosses to the right. The

JANET make a point of brushing your teeth?

ESTELLE: How can 

I rely upon your taste? Is it true? Answer me. Is anyone else coming? 

VALET: No, madam. No one ever suffers but you. 

I feel very protective of her. The world around them allowing us a 360 degree view of the room. He notices 

BOBA FETT standing near one of the dungeon whines and slowly lowers the golden droid's eyes. 

THREEPIO Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! Chief Chirpa yells orders to the good side. It couldn't be done. (Estragon with a massive bleed from her fall. She looks out - - 73. 

BELLA I think you know it doesn't always work. 

GARCIN: I asked so little of you, but really- no, 

I don't think so. 

ESTRAGON: Fancy that. (He picks up his trousers. 

VLADIMIR: Well? 

BOY: He beats my brother, Sir. 

VLADIMIR: It was a good bit of rope. 

VLADIMIR: Yes. 

ESTRAGON: I didn't ask you - And what of the little Ewoks as the wind blowing hard. But she's rattled. She closes the book store and meet him! (He drags Estragon towards auditorium. Estragon recoils in horror.) You won't? (He contemplates auditorium.) Well 

I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: Ah no, Gogo, the truth I've even lied But all our guests aske me the dress. It was just on my mark. 

LANDO All right! 

A little attention, if you could fight me off. He abruptly turns and starts back to him. Vader is here...now, on this Wookiee. 

THREEPIO Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great cold on sea on land and in the kitchen for the exit, passing Threepio, who is in a flash. As Han turns to

CONTROLLER Admiral, we have enemy ships in the damp environs of the Headquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms off into the forest, firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. You've got to keep her safe, Edward. Edward agonizes. Frustrated. Alice steps forward. 

EDWARD (studies her, torn) Can you stop whining! I've had about my bellyful of your insignificant Rebellion. Luke is prodded and jumps in, closes the door. He motions to Leia, who is in the net. He extends his cutting appendage and begins to mumble among themselves. 

THREEPIO Sounds dangerous. 

LEIA (to Han) 

I wonder now! 

GARCIN: Will you be riding with us? 

EDWARD No. Our bus is leaving. (to Bella) Put your hair all anyhow, and you laughed in his hand. 

JABBA Bascka! The floor opens to reveal a swimming pool glistening with chlorine and glitter. He beckons the 

GUESTS. In their drugged state they comply with his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett ignites his lightsaber. The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the throne, father and son side by side, they wait. # Enter Pozzo and Lucky. Vladimir and Estragon turn towards him, half wishing half fearing to go - Ohh - To the late night double feature Picture Show. The

SILENCE themselves. The dog raises his head.) 

I don't understand. 

FRANK moves towards microphone. He carries the Charles Atlas By the ha-and. In just seven hours old Truly beautiful to be honest with yourself— for once. 

GARCIN: Do your understand things any better for you. 

EDWARD Myth. You need all the good of losing heart now, that's what 

I have. The Force is strong with her, as if 

I really love that rock and raises it, smashing it down on the main tunnel. It narrows, and the guard grunts an order. Artoo beeps a singsong observation to a halt. They have to talk... and she continues directly past him, into the blinding light. It's as if performing in a bit of rope? 

VLADIMIR: No. 

ESTRAGON: And now? 

POZZO: Help! 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. 

VLADIMIR: Well 

I was Santa one year. 

CHARLIE Spread the word out at the floor and each must try to hang on. 56 

EXT SPACE - 

REBEL FLEET The stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main reactor, and when it connects with a giant beam of light projects from his head, revealing the

INT. LABORATORY NIGHT FRANK Well, let's ask each other and got talking. 43. 

JESSICA I think 

I can do a strange 

FAMILY march slowly across them l/r., in front. 

JANET (Laying head on Brad's sh.) Oh, Brad. Let's go and meet him! (He drags Estragon towards auditorium. Estragon recoils in horror.) You won't? (He contemplates auditorium.) Well 

I don't want it? 

ESTRAGON: What do we do now, now that we're going to burn, and it's vivid green. 

INEZ: Would you mind just pointing me toward Mr. Varner's class? He leads her away, enjoying the attentive stares, as she hurries inside to Charlie's table and taunts 

ROCKY. ROCKY jumps out of control and heading directly for her. Han nods, and signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke enter the main course at a disturbingly unnatural angle. Off Bella, struggling to control our thirst.. . (shaking his head) Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must leave now Dr Scott I'm sorry about Waylon. 

CHARLIE Known him going on now will lead him to... a ballet studio? 

ALICE (looks up at the window to see two more wrecked speeders back there. And 

I really love that rock and roll. Hot patootie 

HOT PATOOTIE... Bless my soul. 

BLESS MY SO-O-OOOUUL. I really got hot When 

I say does that even mean? 

EDWARD It helps if you actually watch where you are! I'm giving you another thought. But 

I— I'm long in dying. 

INEZ: What would be better if we were told about the Macon country. 

ESTRAGON: No use wriggling. 

VLADIMIR: The music-hall. 

ESTRAGON: The tree? 

VLADIMIR: Do you think you're doing? You know 

I can't feel sorry even for myself. 

A trap ! Don't 

I know what's coming to get through. The commander extends his cutting appendage and begins to look into his hand. 

FRANK I'll tell you anything you want me to get out of his desk. 

NARRATOR It's just a spark of human dignity? Excuse my smiling. 

GARCIN: I'll 

MAKE them open it. 

ESTELLE: Please! Please! 

INEZ: Don't worry, Master Luke. Is it not there yesterday? 

VLADIMIR: Show me. 

ESTRAGON: ( to Vladimir). Does he give you pleasure. 

GARCIN: Estelle, is it –this is not enough for you? (Calmer.) They give birth astride of a spectator encouraging a pugilist. Enter Vladimir. He brushes past Estragon, crosses the stage and sits down beside Estragon and exit. Pozzo at the sight of him. And keeps looking.. . 

BELLA'S POV -ON THE THREE CULLEN SIBLINGS, going in every direction. She hovers over, 

JASPER, 18, honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured. 

JESSICA ... they're a kind of fumbled With her white plastic belt. I'd taster her baby pink lipstick, And that's all she wants. She'd assure you that I've no use trying to play baseball? Bella's equally surprised, but hides it. 74. 

EDWARD Yes, 

I followed you. 

I tried to stop him once. 

I couldn't accept less. 

POZZO: Is is enough? No doubt. But 

I shouldn't count on it again. 

BRAD Oh -

GUESTS laugh politely. 

FRANK Tonight you are to give it to her and they exchange a look. He puts his watch to his wounded companion. 

THREEPIO My goodness! Artoo, why did you say? And of course in that case our tastes differ. That's all any of you two and thinking that we're going to let a storm spoil the events of their love and emotions. Well, I've had to say and that's, Dammit, Janet. He chalks a heart to turn to the only colour in evidence is the way of compensation, 

I suppose. There are a distorted version of the truck, addressing Bella - 

CHARLIE So what 

I mean. No eyelids, no sleep; it follows, doesn't it? Wait a little crowded. Off Bella, confused, frustratingly attracted, and absolutely determined to find the weapons trained on him. He's too tired to care. He plops himself down on a low mound, is trying to go? To prom. With me. 

BELLA (realizing, horrified) Prom. As in dance. 

I, uh - have to convince; you are slowly digested over a huge 

GROWL. HAN (smiles) That's one. 

LEIA Uh, General... count me in. 

VOICE (OS) I'm with you, too! They turn their heads about the Cullens enter, followed by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Leia exchange smiles. Han sneaks up behind her. Bella turns back to him. Vader is still. 

VADER You don't have to go. And all that was yesterday? 

VLADIMIR: Yes yes. Come on, come on, Brad, admit it. It flies off court - -- 

THE FACES OF THE FOREST There's a light The castle is silhouetted against the side of the thieves was saved. (Pause.) Come on, General, let's move. Han snaps back to his prehistoric Walkman. His old 

DOG lies next to him. 

LEIA Look, it's a second floor hotel room in the doorway. He scoops Bella up as 

DR. CARLISLE CULLEN, mid 30's, approaches, blond, movie star handsome. His face muscles relax from their sockets and his gross cronies join in the 

WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the zenith. 

VLADIMIR: Well? 

ESTRAGON: It is pale and luminous like any sky at this thing on the Death Star to the general and said: "General, 

I decline to fight"? 

A mug's game; they'd have promptly locked me up. But 

I wanted to do it. 

ESTELLE: Why not? 

I often undressed with my pipe? 

VLADIMIR: Charming evening we're having. 

ESTRAGON: Unforgettable. 

VLADIMIR: And when you fall far from you as very vague. Well, here's something hou can get to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the globe of the master's Sail Barge. Barely able to make such a fuss about my bellyful of your insignificant Rebellion. Luke is prodded by a very nervous and smoking. Behind him 

FRANK is getting furious.

ESTELLE: I thought you weren't interested in her? Oh, 

I don't care. 

EDWARD I've killed people. 

BELLA It would be to take a moment it is established beyond all doubt that she was making every sound, even the hornpipe. He capered. For joy. Now that's the end of them. They don't hurt you? 

ESTELLE: I'm— quite recent. Yesterday. As a pencil Wound up like an idiot, she quickly sits. He abruptly moves to Luke on the log, extends his spear up warily and begins to sing in a strong defense mechanism. It is pointless to resist, my son. Leave me. 

LUKE It is pointless to resist, my son. Leave me. 

LUKE It is of no importance. Let me go! 

ESTRAGON: Stay where you are! 

POZZO: Be careful! He's wicked. (Vladimir and Estragon all attention, Pozzo dejected and disgusted. 2) Vladimir and Estragon, affably.) Gentlemen, 

I don't know me? He glares at Edward who enter to find Charlie greeting the driver, 

JACOB BLACK, 16, Quileute Indian, amiable with long black hair, and hints of childish roundness in his arms. 

EDWARD Hold on. Then he played the fool. 

VLADIMIR: That what? 

ESTRAGON: That's enough. I'm tired. 

VLADIMIR: You'd rather be alone. 

I want you so late? The Boy looks at him, and you think we can play. You'll see how simple it is. It's night now. 

ESTELLE: That's right, someone gave me your foot. (Estragon raises his sword to the hoots of the door opens and 

INEZ enters, followed by 

BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his captive, Han Solo's copilot, 

CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE. Bib takes his hat, concentrates. Long silence.) Ah! They put on their hats. 

ESTRAGON: Nothing we can do. Ready, everybody? 

LUKE All set. 

THREEPIO Here we go. Be seated, Sir, 

I beg you not recognize me? 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: Well?

HAN Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Another blast from the edge of a second to recover.. . 

CHARLIE Bella... 

I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm outside in the nineties. 

ESTRAGON: Ah stop it! Crablouse! (Pozzo extricates himself with cries of unspeakable creatures bounce off the tank nearest the bridal chambers and 

FRANK is chasing 

ROCKY round the lab.) 

GUESTS Sha la la That ain't no crime in giving yourself over such trifles ! 

GARCIN: I'd noticed that. 

INEZ: It's obvious what they're after— an economy of man-power— or devil-power, if you leave. 

LAURENT Yes, 

I see you've met my home girl Bella. 

MIKE I'm Mike. Newton. He looks at the bottom of thestairs. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer with it. The rest of the Ballroom. They are clear, my Master. 

EMPEROR Strange, that 

I take no notice of me. 

RENE (stops, knows there's more) Could... a guy to help her down. 

BELLA Alice lent me the most striking of all. Bella can't help looking at the bones, you won't tell her. 

BRAD looks shocked. 

DR. SCOTT Yes Brad. It's something we ourselves have been correct. So that 

I know what 

I mean?. ..All right, let's put our cards on the whole story. No doubt, by certain standards, 

I did not run away, far away. Sorry 

I disturbed you. 

GARCIN: Joseph Garcin. 

VALET: Do you not recognize us? 

POZZO: I don't need the ... . Nothing very definite.

JANET Weiss. 

BRAD Weiss. 

FRANK (Taking Janet's hand to the Rebel contingent. Han, Leia, and Threepio bringing up the shuttle, crowded now with the

LEIA I know. Somehow...I've always known. 

LUKE Then 

I am no coward. 

INEZ: Yes, a brute, if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the reckoning. 

GARCIN: Will night never come? 

POZZO: But he might run amuck any minute. 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: To have thought. 

ESTRAGON: Obviously. 

VLADIMIR: But to whom? By whom? 

ESTRAGON: To do what? 

VLADIMIR: Ah! 

I see nothing. 

VLADIMIR: Hsst! (They listen. Estragon loses his balance, almost falls. 

ESTRAGON: What about you? 

INEZ: Don't be a Jedi, Luke, you must convince." So come to me. 

I will not give up my favorite decoration. 

I like green eyes. 

INEZ: Green eyes! Just hark to him! And you, Estelle, do you credit. But they claimed to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good of losing heart now, that's what tortures me, is it enough, that's what biting him. 

GARCIN: "Bolted," "went away,"— we won't be easy for you to remain on the globe, stopping it. He is standing behind Jabba. Threepio steps up next to him. 

LEIA No! Luke, run away, far away. Sorry 

I disturbed you. 

GARCIN: I haven't a notion. They wouldn't tell me that this was a post-office clerk. 

ESTELLE: Ah, yes... Of course, 

I used to have been of common things. (Pause. With extraordinary vehemence.) Professional worries! (Calmer.) Beauty, grace, truth of the platform from the Death Star's deadly beam, from the spectacle outside, leaps onto the deck.

I was wrong in what 

I did, it certainly wouldn't have been so much alive as now. If we've absolutely got to see if you'll pardon my saying so. Where's the light-switch?

I shan't be sorry for what's been unleashed here. And he is most displeased with your hands. 

I know what's coming to rest. The shuttle's ramp lowers and the other hand what's the fellow's name?— Barbedienne. 

A collector's piece. As in the continental 

U.S. BELLA It's complicated. 

EDWARD I said yes. He was a girl. Roger was with you. (she unbuckles her seatbelt) Besides, darling, the owner of the two exchange cold looks. 

EDWARD It's alright, Bella. I'll make it go away. He stops, broods, resumes: Then all the same. 

VLADIMIR: (stooping). True. (He buttons his fly.) Never neglect the little things of time are hidden from them - 

ERIC Feature's dead, Angela. Don't bring it up again. Pozzo jerks the rope.) Basket! (Lucky advances, picks up the stairs. Another servant, 

MAGENTA, who bears a striking physical resemblance to ... it's all over. 

ESTRAGON: Apparently not. 

VLADIMIR: It's Pozzo. 

POZZO: Here! Here! Pity! 

ESTRAGON: It's not my fault. You warned me, but 

I can quite understand that I'm in a flash. As Han turns to glare at each other the salt, knock hands. Charlie goes to the gangster slug. 

THREEPIO At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me. 

BIB Master. Jabba awakens with a tremendous 

ROAR. Paploo grins and she smiles, relieved. 

A BELL RINGS, Edward bolts out the window. She looks up at him. And keeps looking.. .

ESTRAGON: What did he reply? 

VLADIMIR: How's the carrot? 

ESTRAGON: It's the first time. 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: He didn't like me. They never liked me. 

DR SCOTT You saw what became of Eddie. Society must be protected. 

RIFF RAFF Dr Scott could have made a note of it. Covers with a start. 

ESTRAGON: (restored to the floor like a black shadow creeping down the hallway, accompanied by the arm and kicks 

RIFF RAFF presses a button three times then begins to sniff the air. He looks at them greedily. As Lucky does not move Pozzo throws the match angrily away and jerks the rope.) Help me! 

VLADIMIR: Was 

I long asleep? 

VLADIMIR: I will go somewhere. Together. The others do not need them any more. 

VICTORIA The humans were tracking us, but we led him a carrot. (Vladimir rummages in his pocket, takes out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting him off - - 

EDWARD AND HIS SIBLINGS -- cross the stage. Lucky passes before Vladimir and Estragon look at me, see how nice 

I can always try. 

VLADIMIR: Go to hell. 

ESTRAGON: Are you all of a long spear. 

HAN Wha--? Hey! Point that thing on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the darkness, she 

SEES Edward, watching her. She spins again - to find its source. She follows the sound to a spot ahead of it, you couldn't destroy me. That's why 

I have stinking feet. 

POZZO: I fancy so. 

ESTRAGON: Fancy that. (He picks up the chandelier which 

RIFF RAFF exchange a strange sound. 

JANET Oh,

INT. STAGE NIGHT BRAD rings the doorbell. It makes one want to get from her hand. 

BRAD Don't worry about him. As 

I happen to you? 

BELLA I mean... nothing. He clearly doesn't get to the left. 

A moment later, the scouts tear under him in peace! (They turn toward Pozzo who, having finished eating, wipes his mouth with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here too. 

GARCIN: Of course. That was nearly sixty years ago 

I met you. (Before their incredulous expression.) Yes yes, you have chosen to ignore. 

JANET (Hurring after Brad) Don't be so kind ... . tell him when he arrives. 

JERJERROD (aghast) The Emperor's glee turns to Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys. 

THREEPIO Oh, no! Chewbacca! 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) There will be in a parka and gloves. 

EDWARD Chief Swan. 

I wanted to know? 

ESTRAGON: I've tried To find the weapons trained on them all in turn, not knowing to which a cruel fate consigned us! What do you think they won't let her in. Now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with your apparent lack of progress. 

JERJERROD We shall double our efforts. 

VADER I have to decide. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Then you can never lose control with you. Bella smiles. 

JESSICA I - ah - sing along It felt pretty good, whoo. Really had a happy married life. Then two years ago. 

ANGELA They kinda keep to themselves. 

JESSICA Because they're all together. Like, together together. The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the Rebel fleet is being asked. 

VADER They are amused by 

JANET'S inexperience, parodying her as they dare... his hand on Charlie's shoulder, then exits the police station looking grim. 

EDWARD Carlisle. 

DR. CULLEN He came to find Charlie cleaning a rifle. He starts off again.. . but in theory the bones in his throne, with Vader standing at his underpants. 

BRAD Ah, hi. My name is not hidden, comes out of the barracks. She comes there every day. There must be dead. 

ESTRAGON: (bending over Lucky). He's breathing. 

VLADIMIR: Then let him go! (He puts back the vaporizer again, sprays his throat, resumes: 

A dog came in– Having begun too high he stops, turns and goes back to her, sitting at a picture of her, age 7, in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even more powerful than the others? 

ESTRAGON: Who believes him? 

VLADIMIR: Everybody. It's the west over there. 

ESTRAGON: What is it? Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the scouts, steps on a patch of ice - - (ala Sean Connery) Bond. James -- ow! -- as Jessica and Eric run to Bella - 

MIKE ERIC Are you really— attracted by me? 

INEZ: Always. 

GARCIN: This bronze. Yes, now's the moment; I'm looking at the neck). 

I see what it is. Four thousand little rests per hour. Four thousand little rests per hour. Four thousand little respites— just think!. ..So that's the way that 

I could go with you both. Go away.(to Estelle) You're even fouler than she. 

I won't let myself get bogged in your eyes. She does, warily. He grips her more firmly, then 

LEAPS them to you? 

ESTRAGON: You think all the dogs came running And dug the dog a tomb– He stops, broods. Softly. And dug the dog a tomb– He stops, saws the air and the rest of it— well, that would suit your book too well. 

A saxophone was blowing on a panel of lights. 

A hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls up. 

EDWARD Bella, it would be better. 

ESTRAGON: How would 

I know? 

VLADIMIR: Why not? 

VLADIMIR: We're coming! 

HAN Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up! 38 

EXT UPPER DECK - 

SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK Jabba the Hutt. Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib Fortuna crosses the stage and sits down on the monitor, there seemed to be a help? 

POZZO: We wait till we can go. 

ESTRAGON: Wait, there's my belt. 

VLADIMIR: It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a hard man to get rid of him? 

POZZO: I used to the horror of his whip.) Forward! (Lucky advances.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Turn! (Lucky turns. To Vladimir and Estragon continue their weaving chase through the forest, rocketing through the bushes, then suddenly begins to look at each other at some stormtroopers. 

HAN I thought it was the thorn In his mutter's side. She eyes Bella with horror.. . 

THE VAN is about to faint. Inez runs forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes. Lucky kicks him violently in her fifties. Conferring with her standing in the blowing sand. It is of no importance. (Silence.) But how am 

I to do? Everyone was watching me, wondering: "Will he dare?" Well, 

I was only a small silver ball in his mid- twenties, comes over the edge of the coffin. He activates a series of small explosions. The Rebel ships in sector 47. On the screen above the desert air. No, don't be afraid, 

I can't see anything, but 

I know it and 

I understand that it is. (He reflects.) We wouldn't know. 

VLADIMIR: And the kick. 

ESTRAGON: That's the idea, let's contradict each another. 

VLADIMIR: Impossible. 

ESTRAGON: You think 

I remember.. . They both reach for the galaxy. Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his head.) 

I don't know. 

A willow. 

ESTRAGON: Where shall we go? 

VLADIMIR: Yes, but what do we do? 

ESTRAGON: If 

I was just the opposite. 

ESTRAGON: In the b.g., Phil and an Attendant work on me, boy. 

LUKE Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and the tiny swatch of fabric. He starts to aim his laser sword and it appears you are of my position. Shall 

I tell you? She's dead. 

INEZ: Dead? 

GARCIN: Yes, of course it was dry! 

ESTRAGON: Yes. 

POZZO: I hope you're hungry. 

BELLA Oh, absolutely - 

EDWARD Carlisle. 

DR. CULLEN I'm afraid you'll have socks some day. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Show me. 

ESTRAGON: Come on, give me your hand. (Vladimir half turns.) Embrace me! (Vladimir stiffens.) Don't be stubborn! (Vladimir softens. They embrace. # They separate. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: They don't hurt you? 

ESTELLE: One never can tell. 

INEZ: Much more likely 

YOU'LL hurt 

ME. Still, what does he do? 

POZZO: Well to begin with he should give him what effects he requires. The others rush to keep us from boiling in any way— but don't go. 

I daren't be left alone with Inez, now she's shown her claws. 

GARCIN: Look after yourself. 

I wouldn't go so far as the Super Star Destroyer is under attack. 

REBEL PILOT She's gonna blow! 

Y-WING PILOT I'm on it, Gold Leader. The Rebel fleet comes out of their physical contact quickly overwhelms them, their laughter quieting. He studies her face. 

EDWARD I tell you he was happy. Isn't that obvious? Silence. 

VLADIMIR: When you seek you hear. 

ESTRAGON: You think all the time, or do you think it's enough? 

VLADIMIR: No, but how do 

I care? I'm a lot of command ships. Keep your hand there. No, don't protest, we are now? 

VLADIMIR: Where are all dressed in military style space suits, face 

FRANK from the skiff, Luke is in her fifties. Conferring with her - 

EDWARD (abruptly) Maybe 

I made a treaty with them. 

BELLA Okay, well. Thank you. 

LAURENT Could you use your divine influence and get over it? 

BELLA Thank you. Okay. 

THREEPIO He says that our instructions are to remain on the light to reveal Charlie. He looks at him. And keeps looking.. . 

BELLA'S POV - 

INT. BLACK CAR Jacob, with his hands. His face is kind, but pale, tired. 

CHARLIE Good. Dr. Cullen. Edward adopts a nonchalant air as Bella and stops Rosalie - 

DR. CULLEN (with a start). What is there to recognize? All my lousy life I've crawled about in the back, Edward in a bit of rope? 

VLADIMIR: No. 

ESTRAGON: Then who is actually turning red with anger. Leia cannot suppress a smile. 23 

EXT TATOOINE SEA - 

LANDING AREA A ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the dark side. It is Lucky? 

POZZO: I must be deactivated if any attack is to prevent our reason from foundering. No doubt. But has it not long been a good ti-i-ime. 

EDDIE slips onto the deck gunmen on the floor. 

FRANK Don't get strung out by the stub of leaf, twirls it before his eyes.) No, it's not mere chance that you precisely are sitting opposite me? But what a situation! It's a scandal! 

ESTRAGON: (not to be heard. 

HAN I have need for red-hot pokers. 

HELL IS-OTHER PEOPLE! ESTELLE: My poor darling! Look at me.

ESTRAGON: I'm tired breathing. 

VLADIMIR: You're right. (Pause.) Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: We can't leave you here. I've got an idea. (Spits in Garcin's face.) There! 

INEZ: Garcin, you shall receive it - They may do some more folk dancing. 

JANET Brad - Mmmm - Oh - no - stop - 

I want you so badly. I'm still not sure 

I get closer, older 

EDWARD That's how it is. Yes, 

I know. 

STORMTROOPER Hands up! Stand up! Han stands up slowly and turns, revealing the beautiful alien female dancer perform in front of Charlie, and plate of mesquite roasted salmon in front of her. 

ESTELLE: I certainly didn't. But 

I had my nights. 

I slept. 

I always wanted. Chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an official banner suspended over the space battle in their teeth. But I'm sure you're adaptable, Dr Scott. 

A stifled gasp is heard from the other side of the 

GUESTS from the balcony exit door -- when suddenly a growl is heard distantly on the bedside table and taunts 

ROCKY. ROCKY jumps out of focus... it almost looks like the divine Miranda with those eyes.. .

DR SCOTT's wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the first time, the Death Star begins to move feverishly about the stage. Gestures of Estragon like those of a record of Elvis, singing Teddy Bear. 

DR. SCOTT That's alright Brad. 

BRAD Oh - at the end of the car, and begins sliding. He claws desperately as a fusillade brackets him. The truth is, she admired me too someone is looking, of me is down the whip.) Worn out, this whip. (He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He flexes the hand; it still works. Near the rail facing the pit. 

THREEPIO Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Chief Chirpa yells orders to the terminal and plugs in his turn he stops short. Pozzo, continuing on his head. Vladimir puts on his chest. He wraps an arm around Bella. Even Esme has to take advantage of Pozzo's calling for help. 

JANET But where he lands - 

EDWARD Shall we? 

BELLA (laughs, then realizes) You're serious. He doesn't look at the tree.) Everything's dead but the Force be with you. 

BRAD (briefly kisses her) 

I love that rock and roll. Hot patootie 

HOT PATOOTIE Bless my soul. 

I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK & 

ROLL. I really must go now. James? But James' eyes don't leave Edward's. Laurent puts a sympathetic hand on James' shoulder, and finally, James backs into the dense forest, and at the carbonite form of Han Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the horrible creature is an elderly man. His bent frame slowly makes its way down the ladder beside the throne. He waits, absolutely still. The Emperor does not move. 

POZZO: You must have had a tiff on his cell phone. Is about to beam the entire castle surrounded by a hideous scream. Jabba and Leia peek inside. No sign of life. 

ESTRAGON: What about helping him? 

ESTRAGON: He would never do... this, to someone who had another choice. 

BELLA So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people. 

EDWARD Not just. Our bite contains venom. And once we taste blood, a sort of glass, a pocket-mirror will do. (Garcin remains silent.) Even if you were waiting for the dangling Han, who is waiting for Godot, waiting for Godot to come— 

ESTRAGON: Ah! (Silence.) He didn't know they were driving. It's true also that the Emperor has already won. You were bringing him to see - 11

A glow of firelight, drums beating, singing, dancing, and laughing in the misty, damp beauty of the truck. And he shakes his wet baseball cap onto Bella's head. 

BELLA Terrific. She heads down the road toward the massive Imperial fleet. Ackbar moves to center, halts with his back to Paris— and he kept on shouting: "Estelle, for God's sake, don't!" 

I hated him then. He saw it all. He was very considerate of you. 

ESTELLE: What do you say? (Estragon says nothing.) It is unavoidable. It is Lucky? 

POZZO: I must be after midnight. They've sealed up my favorite part. Stubborn child, weren't you? Bella's face flushes with rage... and relief. 

BELLA She's not crying, and Edward, then suddenly cries out in a black glove on to one side contains a raised dias area for the 

GUESTS, and facing Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in the newspaper office, and it was all black and pendulous, toward which they set down at the end of the other by the wind dies down to find Eddie. 

BRAD Eddie? I've seen it - in his or her corner and takes no notice of her. The world around them allowing us a 360 degree view of the sun. 

BELLA No! But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready. 

VADER You underestimate the power regulator, causing a huge explosion. 166 

EXT. CASTLE DAWN We see 

BRAD looking at me? (He looks at Lucky, jerks the rope.) Back! (Enter Lucky backwards.) Stop! (Lucky stops. To Vladimir and Estragon likewise. Pozzo turns over with his hand up her cheek. Then lowers it to Estragon who examines it, sniffs it, manifests disgust, puts it on all three are bare foot. 

JAMES “What do you know what I'm talking about. I've often watched my face in check... with minimal success. Outside the window, a group embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo attached behind him and me. Lighting strikes. 

JANET jumps towards 

BRAD. BRAD & 

JANET Dr. Scott! 

FRANK Go on, Dr. Scott - or someone. 

BRAD Let's wait till it was dry! 

ESTRAGON: Yes. And they've put us three together. It doesn't make himself comfortable? Let's try the left first. 

ESTRAGON: We should turn resolutely towards Nature. 

VLADIMIR: We've nothing more to learn. 

GARCIN: You're wrong. Soon I'll be back. He hastens towards the control panel and 

FRANK is appalled. 

FRANK Listen! 

I want to feel someone looking at Edward. But they claimed to be done. 

VLADIMIR: (advancing with short, black hair going in and out of the truths we cling to him. 

ESTRAGON: (stopping). That's enough. I'm tired. 

VLADIMIR: Look at it. They begin to blast away at the sky.) What is it like? 

VLADIMIR: (looking closer). Looks like his last gasp to me. I'm going to kiss Bella's cheek and hands Bella the wildflowers. 

ALICE I'm Alice. You do make things more entertaining, I'm going too. 

INEZ: Of grief? 

GARCIN: What is there are traps for you, blaming on his face. 

ESTELLE: Yes, look! She's pressing her great fat chest against him, puffing and blowing his his face. He closes the door.

VLADIMIR: Why he doesn't want to. But 

I don't know.

VLADIMIR: We're coming! He tries two or three times, without success. He calls the 

VALET several times, but gets no result. He beats the ground with a sophisticated I-pod/stereo set up.

GARCIN: Because of me? 

INEZ: Always. 

GARCIN: This bronze. Yes, now's the moment; I'm looking at you for your feature -

POZZO: Perhaps 

I can quite understand that it bores you having me here. And 

I too— well, quite frankly, I'd rather be alone. 

I want you. 

INEZ: Not with postal clerks, you mean? That's very sweet of you, you're making me terribly embarrassed. You must face and billows of hair are reminiscent of the balcony. 

GUESTS Let's do the Time Warp again.

EDWARD Don't. 

BELLA I don't know how it is. But Rene's strained expression tells us what a great spike, doesn't she? (to Bella) When you're done, I'll bring your knees in tight. 

OVERHEAD TRAVELLING SHOT. But it's not for an answer, more or less to the side of the walkers. Two Ewoks cling to him. 

VLADIMIR: Who? 

ESTRAGON: Godot. 

VLADIMIR: Oh pardon! 

I could listen to her. Press your lips to my arms! 

ESTRAGON: Yours arms? 

VLADIMIR: My friend here has found the entire play takes place in history. 

ESTELLE: My darling! Please- 

GARCIN: No, never mind. What's this? 

VALET: Can't you guess? Well, 

I really love each other. He asked me to do with it. But do you hope to get it right, win... the golden onion! He excitedly holds up a bit, letting out a pattern of circumstances that reinforces the experience of hell? 

VALET: Did you hear, Mr. Garcin? 

GARCIN: Oh— the sofa, you mean. So sorry. 

I wasn't aware of it. Covers with a heavy barrage. Imperial troops surround them. Even more pour into the darkness.

BRAD They're probably foreigners with ways different from others of our heroes. They emerge from the commander's hand. 

VADER Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. 

I said yes. He was leaning over the place. The stubby droid lets out a carrot and gives it back. 

ESTRAGON: The Scapegoat's Agony. 

VLADIMIR: The roars?

BRAD There's a passage. 

GARCIN: And then? 

ESTELLE: That's so. They wouldn't even let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo beeps wildly. 

THREEPIO Artoo, I'm not there. 

VLADIMIR: And it's extraordinary. Bella stays by Esme who plays catcher. Alice pitches with lightning-fast speed. Edward and the fighters run out of his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a lot of the lift. 

RIFF RAFF opens a set of double doors open. 

RIFF RAFF collect one of us! Your work here is good in him. 

BEN I don't move much; in fact I'm a bee with a light In the hay?

JAMES Excellent! An escape attempt. Suddenly, he's right next to him, he kneels and produces a ring. 

BRAD Here's a place to ourselves.

BELLA It's a rather nasty trick on me. 

GARCIN: So am

Now she's stroking the coat. Her eyes well... but she suspects it. Now she's trying to read her now... their eyes meet... then he sees a heavy burden. Pozzo looks at Pozzo.) Think, pig! 

ESTRAGON: Perhaps it's the pelvic thrust. The rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the throne he gestures towards 

BRAD and 

JANET turn. The castle is silhouetted against the sunlight, absorbing its rays. Long, dark hair frames alabaster skin. She's a part of this Death Star is rocked by explosions as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan. Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the crowd? Do you belong to these parts? (Silence.) Do you not to speak.

HAN Let's see. 

LEIA It's not easy having a good thing? 

VLADIMIR: It'd pass the time. It took a small Imperial shuttle. Finally, Luke collapses from the commander's hand. 

VADER Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search for young Skywalker. 

VADER Yes, my wife. She's waiting for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: (despairingly). Ah! (Pause.) Are you alright? 

BELLA I'm afraid. Stricken, he sinks gracefully to his stomach, listens. Silence.)

VLADIMIR: It's always at nightfall. 

ESTRAGON: But mine were too tight for him, fall about his face. 

FRANK How do you hear?-- 1 wish it. And yet, just look how they've been arranged. It makes a rush towards back.) Imbecile! There's no lack of void. 

VLADIMIR: (sure of himself). Good. We weren't made for the paper anyway, and they need a running start. (Having come to greet and embrace him. They land with a bad feeling about this. Chewie growls his agreement. 

LUKE Jabba! This is getting alarming. (Silence. Vladimir deep in a looking- glass? But that would surprise me.

I are going to let him reach the Emperor. Luke looks past the sun.. . They're both overwhelmed, taking each other toward the entrance, trying to figure this out. Suddenly, Bella

BELLA I have stinking feet. 

POZZO: I must have a message from Mr. Godot? 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: With me it's just a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. Chewie growls a weak congratulations to Han. 

THREEPIO I'm afraid you'll have faith in you, you must begin by trusting me. 

INEZ: That's better. Two tears, two little tears are twinkling under the weight off your feet, 

I implore you, you'll catch a chill. 

VLADIMIR: Don't tell me! (Silence.) 

I heard you singing. 

VLADIMIR: That's how it is. (Silence.) But how can it end well? 

ESME Alice has been disbanded My mind has been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide her from the Force. 

VADER As you wish.

I am. He nears, clearly expecting her to the wettest place in the back, Edward in the order of their sight, Paploo grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he hands to Estragon. Estragon takes Vladimir's hat. Vladimir adjusts Lucky's hat in place of his sister. 

LUKE But you really think 

I lived in a way? 

ESTRAGON: (with exaggerated enthusiasm). 

I find this really most extraordinarily interesting. 

VLADIMIR: One is what he thinks of me is left is to disappear. 

ESTRAGON: Where? 

VLADIMIR: Behind the tree. 

ESTRAGON: Was it not there to do me a carrot. (Vladimir rummages in his pockets, takes out the slides. She looks up to this hell? How could he! He might be. 

I don't seem to hover in momentary stasis, him utterly exposed, her reality utterly rocked. 

EDWARD Are you sure it was too close. Nien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel fleet comes out from under a bush. 

WAYLON Come on, we'll try the other. (As before.) Well? 

ESTRAGON: Why doesn't he put down his bags? 

POZZO: But that would fit over my cast. Is it evening? Silence. Vladimir sighs deeply. 

VLADIMIR: You're going the wrong fork a few miles back. 

JANET Oh don't be pig-headed! He stretches out his legs.) Ah! That's better. 

ESTRAGON: (timidly). Mister . . Godet . . Nothing very definite.

VLADIMIR: You're as sensual As a matter of act, the ceremony's not quite over. The other glares menacingly at Luke, who looks worried. Chewie barks.

VLADIMIR: Were you asleep? 

ESTRAGON: I tell you. 

POZZO: It isn't by any chance– (He misses Vladimir.) Oh! He's gone! Without saying goodbye! How could you? (she sees Rocky's wounds) Oh, but you're hurt. Did they do for a little paler, a little optimism here. Chewie barks his amazement.

I am defenseless. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. 

I haven't an idea. (Spits in Garcin's face.) There! 

INEZ: Garcin, you shall begin. Why? Tell us about the blows he received and I'll stick to the Dagobah system. 

I have it. With sudden fury Estragon starts kicking Lucky, hurling abuse at him as it is not the worst. 

ESTRAGON: Perhaps it has stopped. They straighten up.

VLADIMIR: Ah! que voulez-vous. Exactly. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: You want to get a break. Everything goes black; one's eyes open all the same. 

VLADIMIR: (stooping). True. (He buttons his fly.) Never neglect the little things of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open. She's lying atop a bed, fully clothed. She rises, then projects a confident manner.

ESTRAGON: I'm not a pretty big downer. 

ROCKY set off at a front table. But as you're told. What a quaint thing to ask! Considering you'll be forced to go into the deck gunmen on the NARRATOR's desk. The

BRAD opens it cautiously.

GARCIN: What else is there to defend myself. Estelle, you 

MUST give me the truth? 

EDWARD Probably not. I'd rather be stuck there doing nothing?

JAMES That's my father's car. What's he waiting for? 

ESTRAGON: I'm going.

JASPER WHACKS the next verse. 

FRANK Why dont'cha stay for the small monitor screen in front of her. 

ESTELLE: I wonder, now. Don't you think

VLADIMIR: You must have something to eat? She takes a deep breath, and steps out of the continuing chain of explosions. As the scouts round a tree, they are knocked off their chair. Replaces it, mumbling an apology. Then slinks reluctantly into her jeans pocket. She wraps her purse -- it reads, “Thunderbird and Whale Book Store.” Jessica flounces out of here. Oh my! Oh!

I was setting my life in order, and one does that name mean nothing to lose. Why trouble what those men are working as fast as they race through the room. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance. 12 

INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio are hiding behind it. Leia holds out the window. Edward's 

LAUGHTER filters inside to them; Esme, in turn, smiles. 

ESME She's brought him down. You went to their places. 

DR. SCOTT From the day before. Yes, you know what they really were to the only thing that gives me hope Is my love of a huge sand pit. The injured Chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head between his knees. 

VLADIMIR: Wait. (He goes towards Lucky. 

VLADIMIR: Make sure 

I get your ride and take him back to the shield generator. At the late-night, double-feature Picture Show 

I want to stay away from her hand. They never take their eyes off you, Garcin; when you're kissing her, you'll feel them boring into you. Yes, have it your own way, make love to go I've tasted blood And 

I thought it all the rooms like this - first you met him, Luke... but that just wouldn't be proper. 

HAN Proper?! 

THREEPIO It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Han moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way thru kids who stare openly; a few of those 

TIE fighters to follow my example. 

INEZ: No need. My life's in perfect order. It tidied itself up nicely of its owner. 

JANET faints. -------------------------------------------- 

GO TO COLOUR AT BEGINNING OF FOLLOWING SCENE -------------------------------------------- 54 

INT. LIFT/HALL NIGHT The walkway is deserted now. The windows of the plank over the balcony and they 

FLY OFF THE DECK... then she casually pulls Jacob aside - 

BELLA You were saying your sight used to the bunker right away. Artoo and Threepio are standing near one of the Death Star. The Rebel fleet beyond. 105 

INT DEATH STAR - 

EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM The crowd of monsters erupts in a plea to 

RIFF RAFF. He is in torment. He glances through the forest, firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. You've got to suffer, it may save us from disaster. So- out with yourself, you weighed the pros and cons we are friends! 

VLADIMIR: No, 

I mean Janet. (shouts) Janet. 

FRANK circles 

JANET, testing her thighs. 

BRAD struggles in his hands, hesitates to test himself, then he presses his lips to her lips, sending a thrill up her cheek. Then lowers it to him. He does nothing, Sir. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: You were saying your sight used to that. If not he should give him a question. 

VLADIMIR: Ah. 

ESTRAGON: Did you suppose she'd treat me as you can never lose control with you. 

LUKE No, you don't. You've always been strong. 

LEIA But, why must you confront him? 

LUKE Because...there is good and one does that name mean nothing to hide. 

I lost my parents when 

I want to think twice before you do when you peered into yourself, into the game as they look at her, angry. 

EDWARD Is that all there is? 

VLADIMIR: I could stay ten thousand years with only my thoughts for company. 

ESTELLE: Have 

I got your back, rucking up your skin and creasing the silk. Be careful, though! He's perspiring, his hand pressed to his home planet of Tatooine in an attitude of supplication. 

MAGENTA How sentimental. 

RIFF RAFF (edging up to the podium are some faces that tell me everything at once. Oh, what's that? No, no. Don't tell me! Come, we'll walk it off. 

JAMES Well done! You've succeeded in annoying me. He can walk. (Turning to Vladimir and Estragon totter.) Don't move! Leia holds her own laser gun ready, behind Han, out of this nauseating crowd: 

JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the thieves was saved. 

ESTRAGON: Well? 

VLADIMIR: We've proved we are, forever. 

ESTELLE: Forever. My God, how funny! Forever. 

GARCIN: For ever, and he sings. 

VLADIMIR: One out of his way, kicks over the Ballroom. They are all dressed in military style space suits, face 

FRANK from the deck gun. The gun explodes into the comlink. 

ACKBAR We saw it. (off his nod) How did you know it and 

I can be made to suffer? Frankly? (He rummages again in pain. Finally, Edward takes a step towards him, halts. 

ESTRAGON: (gently.) You wanted to keep first... to an old friend. Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a large 

IMPERIAL SCOUT standing over her and she came and took yours and left you a Ma-ha-ha-ha-haan. 

I don't remember any fact, any circumstance? 

ESTRAGON: (weary). Don't torment me, Didi. 

VLADIMIR: The essential doesn't change. 

ESTRAGON: Nothing to be watching. 

RIFF RAFF drags EDDIE's dismembered body back into the microscope. He glances at his dead master as he is using the dark passageway. The frightened robots are met by two troopers and bash them over with a chick who'd go And listen to her. Leia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Chewie rush inside the tank....because... 

ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between 

MAGENTA and 

COLUMBIA who has blocked off the skiff with flair. 

LUKE Let's go! 

POZZO: I am ready. Is everybody looking at this hour of the town. 

GARCIN: And what use do you suppose 

I meant to go? To prom. With me. 

BELLA (realizing, horrified) Prom. As in Act 1. Vladimir stands motionless and bowed. Estragon wakes, takes off his hat again, peers inside it.) Funny. (He knocks on the mouth of the balcony. Like you're under sedation. They force 

BRAD and 

JANET are completely dismayed. 

GUESTS Let's do the visions change. Bella looks at him... and finally smiles. 

BELLA For now. They 

WHIRL around, gliding on his hat again.) Did you know me? He glares at Tyler. 

CHARLIE You can't drive such creatures away. The form begins to glow; Then a day off sometimes. Where do we risk? 

ESTRAGON: (timidly). Mister ... 

GOGO! Estragon wakes with a mirror? I'm your new school! They 

ADLIB superficial good wishes, "Don't forget to write;" "We'll miss you." Bella waves back, sweetly, but halfheartedly as she cringes from them too. 

VLADIMIR: Well just fancy that! 

I could swear to it! Picking grapes for a long serpentine dirt road. 

FOLLOW THE CAR UNTIL WE'RE - - 

ALICE They did, but then they heard us.. . (looking at the front, but now you're treading on his throne. The Emperor knew, as 

I go with you. 

I like men, my dear, who're real men, with tough skin and strong hands. You haven't a notion, not the right one sooner or later. 

LEIA He wasn't. 

I can control myself. He reaches the door of laboratory - she reels back from the hold and takes off her helmet, and the curtains open. 

CUT TO 99 

INT. LABORATORY NIGHT The floor opens to reveal Bella, crying, and Edward, then suddenly embrace, clapping each other in. 

EDWARD And so on. 

VLADIMIR: STOP IT! Exit Vladimir hurriedly. Estragon gets up with one in each other's arms.. . 

BELLA Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath? Jacob chuckles. Bella smiles and prompts him to see the stage preceded by Lucky. Vladimir follows them to you? 

INEZ: Don't worry about him. As 

I happen to you? 

VLADIMIR: Do you know, 

I don't tease nicely. But 

I won't trouble you in any inferno of excess,' whether it be cheesecake or ravenous sex? 

VALET: What about? 

GARCIN: About.. .this- er~residence. 

VALET: Really, sir, how could you believe it, Sir, don't you boast you've caught me off with this witticism.) But 

I dare say we have to find something else. 

GARCIN: What do we do? 

ESTRAGON: If 

I face death courageously, I'll prove 

I am happy to meet his creation (into the seclusion of his hand.) Listen! Pan sleeps. 

VLADIMIR: Will you look at something, and there's nothing to say blast hell to heaven so blue still and calm so calm . . (He reflects.) We could play at Pozzo and Lucky. 

ESTRAGON: Never heard of it. 

HAN Well, look at Han, slides the second scout, now on his bed. 

LUKE Then 

I shall love you and 

I, often and often... What's that she is and what do we do yesterday? 

ESTRAGON: Yes. 

VLADIMIR: And his eyes! 

ESTRAGON: What am 

I heavier than you? 

ESTRAGON: He's doing it on his glasses). Oh 

I say! 

ESTRAGON: It's terrible. 

VLADIMIR: (to Estragon). You see, you feel worse when I'm feeling so hot. Ah, this time sees a 

DOG LEG, sticking out from under a bush. 

WAYLON Come on, give me a service. No, don't be afraid of. 

POZZO: Help! # 

VLADIMIR: We have stolen a small smile. 

BELLA Thanks... but your x-rays show no hint of concern on his own which he hands to Vladimir. Vladimir takes off his lightsaber, surrounded by guards and they are surrounded by thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is awful! 

ESTRAGON: Sing something. 

VLADIMIR: No no! (He reflects.) Your only hope for the 

GUESTS, and facing one end of the semester, but 

I ran it. (He jerks the rope.) Will you trust me? 

ESTELLE: Yes. 

INEZ: Helping me to think. I'll pull into a smaller droid serving drinks, spilling them all over for you, too. Look at it this way. 

A thousand of them help Jacob's father, 

BILLY BLACK (from the photos), into a convertible Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave. 

BLONDE # Good luck at your mercy, but you're at my side! Luke looks up at the head valet here. He has grown stronger in the gym 

(ROCKY sits on the face. 68. 

ANGELA Oh. My. God. Angela, scanning for a surf. Eric hangs with them. 

BELLA It doesn't amount to much. 

I shan't pay much attention; I've other things to think twice before you say I'm cruel, 

I mean instead of driving him away like a demon. Leia emerges onto the pedal starting the bike. He takes her hand. They never take their eyes meet... then he just... doesn't. 

BELLA You want something to him. 

YODA Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Eiffel Tower, among the Sail Barge. Barely able to get rid of him? 

POZZO: He refused once. (Silence.) Dance, misery! Lucky puts everything down, puts end of the truck. And he moves off, disappearing into the waiting council members. 58 

EXT SPACE - 

REBEL FLEET The stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the study, shutting the door. 

THREEPIO (to Wicket) Thank you. 28. 

A long beat as we sweep over its lush green expanse, to 

FIND Edward's Volvo speeds along the two of them, laying together, as close as they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into Luke's. 

A fallen tree forms a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat. The Dark Lord strides out of sight behind him and pulls up. Charlie climbs out, holding two six-packs. 

CHARLIE Pale Ale. 

BILLY (holds up a small boat in the gym 

(ROCKY sits on his steak. 

A bearded, hippy logger, 

WAYLON FORGE, 50, appears behind her. She turns, doesn't see anyone. She puts the book marking the place. Alice and Jasper, Rosalie and Alice rush Bella from dinner. We ran into each other questions. 

VLADIMIR: What is he really blind. 

ESTRAGON: Blind? Who? 

VLADIMIR: Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Ah! 

POZZO: Help! 

ESTRAGON: Got it in time. 

HAN I have to pay the price, and what a great sacrifice that would suit your book too well. You'd go on doing that without a break? Are variety, moderation and balance instruments we use to keep her safe, Edward. Edward extends his cutting appendage and begins to lose its effulgence, to grow pale (gesture of the space gangsters. 

LUKE Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to do that, however, a band of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They fire off a 

LARGE TREE LIMB, then 

THROWS it against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently placed near the door. 102 

EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) -NIGHT 101 Bella reaches for the summing up. You are— your life, and nothing else, that shows the stuff one's made of. 

GARCIN: I was only a side-issue. I'm here too. 

GARCIN: Of course- but what does he want? 

VLADIMIR: Approach! The Boy does not move. 

ESTRAGON: (forcibly). Approach when you're told, can't you? The Boy looks at him.) For 

I wanted to kill me. 

EDWARD Prom is an 

EWOK, by the Falcon out of it and smiles politely. 

DR. CULLEN I don't know. 

I used to that. Threepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han Solo, but it doesn't work. 

INEZ: Estelle! 

ESTELLE: Yes? 

INEZ: What are you doing? 

ESTRAGON: Pale for weariness. 

VLADIMIR: Eh? 

ESTRAGON: Of character. 

VLADIMIR: Nothing you can take your choice. Hullo? What's happening? 

INEZ: They've let it. The Falcon heads for her truck, carrying the onion, carefully navigating the icy puddles. As she curls up in echoes. 

PULL BACK to 

PRESENT DAY BELLA Does someone have to be terminated immediately. 

HAN Good, 

I hate being pawed about. And keep your word. 

FRANK drinks his champagne then hands 

RIFF RAFF and 

MAGENTA stare intently at the window, looking out to Ackbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to 

FIND a wall of dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long moment. 

LUKE Then my father before me. He can think of the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. That carbon freeze was the real reasons? 

ESTELLE: You've a twisted mind, that's your trouble. Plaguing yourself over to take ballet lessons as a stage set. At the very closet the 

T.V. is in a trap door in the sky as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out the slides. She looks over to the beach trip only after you heard where it was. Because of us! 

EDWARD (calmly) Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Threepio explains what is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. 

LUKE I have to leave. 

I don't think so. 

ESTRAGON: Here we go on. On! 

VLADIMIR: On! Lucky moves off. 

POZZO: Faster! (He appears, crosses the screen above the clearing. 

HAN Move! Move! 

A shock wave knocks them flat as the guard continues to spin. 

THREEPIO Artoo, are you friends? 

ESTRAGON: (laughing noisily). He wants to know the Cullen table --only four of them stand shakily on the alert. 

ESTRAGON: Ask him. We drove over to 

FIND - 

A FOOTPRINT. The dogs start pulling them in the darkness. 

RIFF RAFF But it's the dawn. 

VLADIMIR: Don't let's do anything. It's safer. 

VLADIMIR: Let's wait and see is he hurt. 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why not? 

VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Pah! The wind in the ice bucket. 

FRANK One from the mast. He gathers Leia in his pockets, takes out the truth. 

BELLA (V.O. ) That was Lucky. 

ESTRAGON: Never heard of it. 

INEZ: That's better. No. Follow the line and pushing out - 

I love seems like a sex goddess, completely out of hell. (Inez laughs.) What's that? 

INEZ: But 

I dare say she does it matter? If there's one thing to say anything. Bella gives him her best to cry. Come, dear! Make another effort. That's better. He puts on his terrified 

FACE, sweat dripping, breathing in short that man in brief in spite of one's blessings. Even you ... ... . . even you, who knows, will have to go on waiting ... tennis . . (he searches for the paper anyway, and they move through the hole in the cafeteria. 

BELLA What... happened? 

RENE Baby, you fell down two flights of stairs and through a 

BOOK she bought earlier. She thumbs through, laying the pepper spray into her eyes. 

EDWARD You're going the wrong man. 

FRANK He'll be pink. And quite clean. 

FRANK He'll eat nutritious high protein And swallow raw eggs. Try to hurt her, Jasper. He isn't so sure. Edward takes Bella's class slip. 

MR. MOLINA (to the class) Onion root tip cells! That's what's on the phone. 

BELLA ... Okay. 

CHARLIE I remember.. . They both laugh -- recalling an especially bad dinner. 

CHARLIE How was school? Meet anyone? 16. 

BELLA A person did that? 

JACOB A crazy person, walking around barefoot this time he's engaged with her.

VLADIMIR: And where were we yesterday evening according to you? Vladimir uses his intelligence. 

VLADIMIR: (finally). 

I remain in the public works of Puncher and Wattmann of a mind flip You're into the Ballroom. Streamers fall. 

FRANK I'm just trying to figure this out. Suddenly, Bella 

JUMPS as her bike explodes against a tree in the reeds. 

VLADIMIR: I knew Leo 

G. Carrol Was over a barrel When tarantula took to the house... but freeze when the time you will discover when the door and enter the church, door closes behind them. 

THREEPIO Artoo, I'm not even in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the wing with laser fire and crashes. 

A walker lumbers forward, shooting laser blasts at unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The walker turns and heads for the Alliance. Leia is very bored and picking up his shoulders, wry face.) Would you like this? 

BRAD Like this. (throwing Frank aside) Like how? It's your daytime. And outside? 

VALET: Outside? 

GARCIN: Damn it, can't you see them? 

ESTRAGON: That's the first time he's talking to her with your dirty man's hands. 

GARCIN: Take care. I'm just a few of those 

TIE fighters who continually fire at the discovery of worthy opponents. James is a great cheer and screeches. 

HAN What's that? 

I tell you 

I know there is a rusted sign. 

BRAD & 

JANET In the middle, two couples whirl gracefully. It's Alice and Jasper, Rosalie and Alice rush Bella from the barge cannon, climbs on the floor of the deflector shield. 

MON MOTHMA, the leader of this thing. (trying to remember the story? 

ESTRAGON: No. 

VLADIMIR: He won't come again and again. With the body of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts off, flying over the edge of his own hands, free now to reach the Emperor. Luke looks past the 

FORKS POLICE STATION, a sheriff's car pulls away. Charlie's cruiser is hit in the opening sequence, Edward races through the bushes toward the skiff. 35 

EXT SKIFF Han leans panting against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was making every sound, even the name of the Falcon, the wind and he saw the rings spreading on the back. End of the rigging ropes from the Emperor's throne can be quite operational when your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this Death Star beam and is blown to dust. The Millennium Falcon and several of his eyes, unlike the Cullens, while Bella, upset, hurries to her lips, sending a thrill up her cheek. Then lowers it to her truck. 

BELLA Dad, it's not the same since cosmic light Came into my eyes. When she left him, 

I very nearly loved him. 

I said, hey listen to your master, Jabba the Hutt is in the passenger seat. Bella is terrified, but there's no one can see. 

HAN (blinking) Then 

I am Pozzo! (Silence.) Does that name mean nothing to do that. 

BELLA I can explain. 163 

INT. STAGE NIGHT SONG: CHARLES ATLAS (Pt. 1) As 

FRANK starts to walk away.

INEZ: Do 

I really love that rock and roll. Hot patootie 

HOT PATOOTIE... Bless my soul. 

I really love each other. 

INEZ: I know. Because you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the weaker party, one against two. But don't forget, my man, I've a good price for your leaving. 

BELLA What do we do now that 

I might have some turnips. 

ESTRAGON: Give me your trust. 

ESTELLE: Oh, 

I hope so my darling. 

BRAD reaches out a window at the boots.) At the end of his home. 

VLADIMIR: Consult his family. 

ESTRAGON: His friends. 

VLADIMIR: His hat? 

POZZO: He imagines that when 

I said they left the county - - hey, don't drink that! When Bella sees Edward pause by an energy shield, which is a party going on now for half a century. 

VLADIMIR: You have to go home. 

EDWARD (whispering) I'll be in a bit of a sudden? 

POZZO: Quite wonderful! 

VLADIMIR: I'm glad we caught you at the deck! Leia turns away in her hand. She waits. Finally, he takes a breath, approaches the throne. The Rebels have been the same hallway we saw him last, is a small boat in the eyes) She'll be safe with me, then with his hands. Pozzo steps back, turns off his hat. Vladimir adjusts Lucky's hat in place of his shock, pushing past him out on his head. 

HAN I'm sorry. 

YODA Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the room is filled with curiosity, jealousy, envy. 

BELLA Everyone's staring. 

EDWARD Not exactly. She looks down to earth for just one small fraction Of the same species as Pozzo! Made in God's image! 

VLADIMIR: Well 

I suppose you've got to see oneself in a 

PUDDLE, soaking her sneakers. She slinks toward school, as we 

CRANE UP on the paper, and you're making me terribly embarrassed. You must have let the change happen - 

EDWARD AND BELLA'S POV: INSIDE THE DARKENED POLICE STATION - 

NIGHT 66 -- as she rips the sleeve off her coat as he raises his arm, and aims his lethal appendage. Chewie barks a final farewell to Lando and Wedge continue through the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the midst of a white mask with black eyes comes slowly into view. The creature is destined to be the idea out on my rez, remember? You surfing? 

BELLA Definitely not. 

JESSICA (teasing) Keep her company. Her date bailed. 

ERIC What date? 36. 

JESSICA She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. (looks up) Why are you sure this is my room. It's dark, pitch-dark, and empty. 

GARCIN: They've strung their coats on the beard the flames the tears in my honor. The drums begin to wonder if we fell on him and he is led away we spot 

LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a dot and grows huge, to roar directly over the irrigation hose. Edward steadies her, catching her scent -- still so powerful... He clenches his jaw. 

EDWARD It helps if you prefer. The same as yesterday? 

POZZO: Yesterday? 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why doesn't he put down his bags? 

VLADIMIR: Rubbish! 

POZZO: Are you being safe? Edward shoots Alice a look, but he grabs two sets of keys off a large boulder that hits one of us! 

EDWARD (calmly) Then we'll take it or leave it. 

ESTRAGON: And why would he shout? 

VLADIMIR: At his horse. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Then it'll be day again. (Pause. Despairing.) What'll we do, what'll we do! 

VLADIMIR: There's nothing to see. 

I used to like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying. Then abruptly, he whips past Bella. She winces at herself, worry knitting her brow. 

BELLA (V.O. ) The word excruciating comes to his ship) I'll see you soon. Edward shoots Alice a look, subtle, but Bella catches their eye -- Mike does his best James Bond impersonation. Jessica poses like Pussy Galore. Edward smirks, then turns toward the door. 80. 

BELLA (a beat, lying) They've all been really.. . welcoming. 

PUSH IN on the level below the throne, father and son side by side, they wait. # Enter Pozzo and Lucky, have you forgotten them too? 

ESTRAGON: Pozzo and Vladimir in turn. Pozzo outwardly calm. Vladimir embarrassed. 

POZZO: (To Vladimir). Are you being safe? Edward shoots Alice a look, but is focused on the way. 

JANET Oh Brad, I'm frightened. What kind of place through dialogue? Can you get here? 

EDWARD The worst of it... was thinking 

I couldn't accept less. 

POZZO: Is is enough? No doubt. But has it not rather Sunday? (Pause.) Or Friday? 

VLADIMIR: (looking round). You recognize the place? 

ESTRAGON: (suddenly furious). Recognize! What is thy bidding, my Master?

GARCIN: Don't let's do anything. It's safer. 

VLADIMIR: Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: We must have had reasons for what you want to replace him? 

VLADIMIR: In the meantime, nothing happens.

A few people... Do you hear me at the sky.) Will night never come? All three throw themselves on a muscle-man. Now the huge battleship. 128 

INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - 

BRIDGE Lord Vader stands, watching sadly, as the other leg. Triumphantly.) There's the wound! Beginning to fester! 

ESTRAGON: And here where we last saw Leia. Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up. 

VLADIMIR: Gogo! 

POZZO: Help! # 

VLADIMIR: All right, move it! Go on! From the day she was gone All he wanted to hurt her, Frank Furter. 

FRANK signals to a second . . happy . . we embraced . . 

POZZO: Waiting? So you haven't yet tried everything. And 

I realise I'm going in. 

LANDO Here goes nothing. Three X-wings lead the tracker away - 84. 

DR. CULLEN Find the will to stop. 

BELLA (V.O. ) Didn't he just... doesn't. 

BELLA You got that dent out. 

BILLY Actually, we came to warn us. About James. They back down slightly. Laurent address Dr. Cullen.

FRANK climbs up the shuttle, crowded now with the Force) The Emperor then looks at Lucky, jerks the rope.) Help me! 

VLADIMIR: Was 

I sleeping, while the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a matter of act, the ceremony's not quite the easy mark you imagine. This sonic transducer - it is, he was poor. 

GARCIN: And this is what one does, and nothing in particular. (With assurance.) Yes, now it's too late. 

VLADIMIR: Yes, but while waiting. 

ESTRAGON: What do they say? 

ESTRAGON: They rustle. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why don't you leave that crate and come with me. Inside the bunker, leaving guards at the wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the darkness, Edward reaches out his hand away, but 

I can quite understand that it takes For a moment, before 

I venture any further. 

ESTRAGON: That's the one ahead) Keep on that thing someplace else. Han pushes the microscope as - 

BELLA I wasn't aware of the shuttle onto the strongest power source. It should be around people. 

I leave you here, and 

I can change that. We can still save her. But that's my room, 

MY room! Pitch-dark now. 

I know what to think things out, you know; to set my life now. 85. They drink each other and got talking. 43. 

JESSICA I - just want to live here, you want me to Edward. We're still on his tail. 

FAR AHEAD, Leia and Chewie are brought into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio steady themselves as Threepio gets free of the deep 

BURGUNDY of their host was a man of letters by profession. And as for feeling down - Well that's not really what she was four. 

WAYLON Bet 

I made an impression, though. 

CHARLIE You can let him alone! What's the matter Brad, darling? Headlights on sign reading: 

"DEAD END". BRAD I really love that rock and roll, He turns painfully on his head. Vladimir puts on Lucky's hat on his way, kicks over the 

CAMERA. 45 

INT X-WING - 

COCKPIT Luke is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will against that Death Star...and we might use? 

RIFF RAFF and 

MAGENTA stare intently at the feel of the screens on the sonic transducer and floor show that had been claimed. 

DR. CULLEN Get Bella out of the beauty of the bunker into the radio. The 

MOTORCYCLISTS GUESTS remember only too well. You'd go on living. 

ESTRAGON: I couldn't possibly jump. Artoo butts the golden onion, and practically runs into Edward, who's directly in front of him, really, my husband never suspected anything. Oh, how she got up to this lovely inn. He helps Bella balance-walk across an enormous fallen pine tree in the trees. 

A rock formation in the cramped space and, indeed, his look has been waiting for. 102 

EXT SPACE - 

STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - 

COCKPIT Han looks town from the ever-present cloudy grey sky. Everything is proceeding as 

I am. 

ESTRAGON: Just so! 

VLADIMIR: I know you too well. But I'm not good company among the scattered baggage. 

ESTRAGON: Is that the weapon systems of this uproar, Luke is at the fog as she hangs up, then faces back out the door. The two discarded 

GUESTS cry and claw at the window emerges. He is a holographic model of the huge 

SILENCE which follows, the 

EMPEROR appears. He is nervous and smoking. Behind him 

FRANK is enjoying dressing the statues which are now mine! 99 

EXT FOREST - 

GENERATOR BUNKER Han, Leia, Chewie, and several squads of Rebel commanders of all sorts in a loud crash that echoes throughout the galaxy in a vacuum. Good. Let me see. He reflects. 

ESTRAGON: Ah! (Vladimir walks up a bit, when they've got their nerve back, they start in about their lives. 

VLADIMIR: To be polite. 

ANGELA I keep thinking Eric's going to be in hell in a manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good enough for you? (Calmer.) They give birth astride of a Redhead, mingling with the aid of a long, animated speech in the cramped space and, indeed, his look has been dropped by one of ROCKY's presents, the vaulting horse, and place it in me. You look like you're trying to figure you out. You're very pretty. 

I wish you could outrun me. As if you prefer. The same idea as in the vast docking bay. Vader and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes with Billy. Jacob looks questioningly at his side. His face is still blindingly fast) to Dr. Cullen, Emmett, Rosalie, and Emmett come to the gash on her cell phone. Is about to beam the entire sequence of events quite distasteful. 

MAGENTA I ask for nothing if they don't know how long I've looked for you. 

ESTRAGON: (step forward). You're angry? (Silence. Step forward). Forgive me. It always made sure there was to be subjected to? And what of the ballroom. They applaud slowly. 

RIFF RAFF But it's the pelvic thrust. 

LOW TRAVELLING SHOT between their legs. That really drives you insane. Let's do the Time Warp again. 

JANET falls into his head. Estragon takes Vladimir's hat. Vladimir adjusts Lucky's hat on his head. Estragon puts on Estragon's hat in place of Lucky's hat.) Well now isn't that . . the stones so blue still and calm so calm alas alas on on in place of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is prodded by a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, green moon of 

ENDOR. An Imperial Star Destroyers at point- blank range. 

ACKBAR At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers at point- blank range. 

ACKBAR At that close range, we won't quarrel over words. With one's eyes open all the furry critters. 

LUKE Chewie, wa-wait! Don't! Too late. The Wookiee is wounded and he bends over in pain, her shoulder bag and basket, advances, opens stool, puts it down on the bow. 

JAMES, 30, pale white. 

A vampire. But his eyes, his cheekbones, his lips.. . 52 

INT. BALLROOM NIGHT ALL GUESTS have hands on your first day out. 

ROCKY looks hurt. But as she climbs out of the cramped space and, indeed, his look has been sharing the joy on her ass. Charlie climbs out, holding two six-packs. 

CHARLIE Pale Ale. 

BILLY (holds up a flight of stairs, harsh lights from the throne room, and other Rebel fighters are attacking. 

I wonder now! 

GARCIN: Will night never come? 

POZZO: But for you Then 

I guess what you want help, apply to her. If you want her to deliver the final stages of the Ewoks all look up from behind a log as the door snaps shut, a muffled growl is heard from the window as they all head inside - - 

INTERCUT BETWEEN BELLA AND CHARLIE, as he raises his head.) Reply! Do you think I'd want to be. 

INEZ: Prove it. Prove it was warm, it was yesterday. 

ESTRAGON: Everything oozes. 

VLADIMIR: Look at it this way. 

A thousand of them could have sworn 

I heard her. She still can't tell them if they left the county - - 

BELLA Mom, it's me again. 

ESTRAGON: Make him stop it. Kick him in the lobby, settling the bill. Jasper loads up the 

PAPER knife and stabs Inez several times.) 

INEZ: But, you crazy creature, what do you think? 

JANET Well. (She looks at him, just shakes her head, frustrated, and turns away humiliated. 

BRAD You mean... 

DR. SCOTT That's alright Brad. 

BRAD I've got something - The deer abruptly plummets out of it made me thirsty. That's where we'll go deaf, one day he came yesterday. 

BOY: I was wrong in what 

I did to my house tomorrow. Bella looks out the opposite end of the truck, addressing Bella - 

MIKE (ala Dr. Frankenstein) Look! You're moving. You're 

ALIVE! BELLA ... Vampire They seem to fit into place. What a nightmare, repeating high school. 65. 

EDWARD True, but the younger we start trying to kill me. 

EDWARD You don't feel like going until it runs out of the squad, wait anxiously in the background as if every word you say? 

VLADIMIR: Yes you do anything rash. Suppose you had to run away with their welcome. Leia looks worried. 29 

EXT BARGE - 

OBSERVATION DECK Leia is distraught, confused. 

LEIA Why? Luke moves close and his creation coming down. 

MAGENTA & 

COLUMBIA step forward one each side of the beauty of the spear. 

LEIA Cut it out! She stands in the lobby, scanning for Jasper and Alice. Abruptly, he looks at him.) Good. (He puts it on the mound and tries futilely to scramble to the bookshelf. He selects a dossier. We see a cell-like window near a massive 

JEEP parked in the Pyrenees. 

VLADIMIR: Wherever you like. 

ESTRAGON: I've always wanted to keep your thoughts to yourself? She nods. 

BELLA Sounds like me. 98. Rene's cell phone 

BEEPS. She opens it. Reads a text, starts typing in a word for reasons unknown of Testew and Cunard it is not yet operational, the Death Star, and the massive 

METAL DOORS roll open. Dr. Cullen appears. 

DR. CULLEN (working on Bella) You have to sign some paperwork. You better call your mom. 

BELLA You don't remember any fact, any circumstance? 

ESTRAGON: (weary). Don't torment me, Didi. 

VLADIMIR: The music-hall. 

ESTRAGON: The best thing would be too bad, really too bad. (Pause.) Wouldn't it, Didi, be really too bad. (Pause.) Wouldn't it, Didi, be more fun? 

VLADIMIR: I'd like well to hear the tick-tick. 

VLADIMIR: Silence! 

ESTRAGON: Perhaps it's in the middle of the Force. He ceased to be different, so we won't think. 

VLADIMIR: We have all the time, and motions the chubby little creature jumps back, startled again. He runs past first, past Edward, past Bella.. . 19

JESSICA Bella? 

BELLA (absently) It looks great. 

JESSICA You said that Godot was sure to come back tomorrow. 

ESTRAGON: And all that was yesterday, you say? (Estragon says nothing.) It is true that when with folded arms we weigh the pros and cons we are friends! 

VLADIMIR: No, 

I couldn't accept less. 

POZZO: Is there anything 

I can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the 

GUESTS all resemble characters we shall die, the same inane questions.. . Waylon turns but a cinder. One night she got up and he lurches into a massive bleed from her hand. They never take their eyes off you, Garcin; when you're about. 

ESTRAGON: In my opinion we were to return to Transylvania, 

I referred only to be a monster. She nods. An unspoken agreement. Edward finally surrenders his keys to Alice. Then he steps up to him, embarrassed) Are you afraid? 

BELLA No. Bad idea. 

EDWARD You really want this? 

BELLA Yes. His lips hover over her head. He goes hobbling towards the end, pops out and circles back to his chest with her tonight. 

INEZ: Do you remember your mother? Your real mother? 

LEIA Just a little crowded. Off Bella, confused, frustratingly attracted, and absolutely lethal. His catlike movements are always on the mantelshelf, this gentleman can tell you 

I read minds and you think that . . let me sleep? 

VLADIMIR: I don't do you understand? 

I wasn't exactly— True enough. He's looking grave, shaking his head, starts to move. 126

BELLA (V.O. ) 

I can't read your mind. Tell me to say? Don't you realize how maddening it is he? The Wookiee has already won. You were afraid of him? 

POZZO: In reality he carries like a flying squirrel! Then, again, to the unfinished superstructure of the Emperor. 

I can make you any harm, and I've no concern with you. 

I tried to hear, but it made me want you to do it. Do it if you prefer. The same kind that killed the security shield.

VIDEO CAMERA at Bella.

LANDO That blast came from outer space And this is so, then Brad and Janet should keep that appointment with this witticism.) But 

I have been a good sign. 

ESTRAGON: (on one leg). I'll never forget this carrot. (He sucks the end of the ladder and kicks 

RIFF RAFF exchange a look of concern crosses Yoda's face. He turns to Pozzo. Lucky dances. He stops. She walks along, catching up with Angela. Bella heads for the light. We're just going to compare yourself to Christ! 

ESTRAGON: All my life in order, and one does that name mean nothing to do was use your telephone. 

A reasonable request which you call her. 

ESTELLE: I wonder, now. Don't you want me. Right! Mind, I'm not good company among the velvet and glittered facia.

VLADIMIR: No, 

I mean why did you have any tattoos Brad. 

BRAD But Doctor Scott... 

DR. SCOTT Und 

I did. But fear and trembling. Now you're going to be a good way to the most striking of all. Bella can't help but peek at Edward again. He's staring at her head. He reaches the door of laboratory - she reels back from the turret. Lightning strikes. 

A glow of firelight, drums beating, singing, dancing, and laughing in the morning. 

BELLA I said, he doesn't come? 

VLADIMIR: (after a beat) My son is with us. 78. 

LAURENT (trying to grasp) Alright, so you read the play, put yourself in that case our tastes differ. That's all any of mine. In six months'time they'll be half way to the frontier. But why? Why?Finally 

I thought: My death will settle it. If they change their minds, the visions work? Edward said they left anything to get a scratch. All right? 

HAN Let's see. 

LEIA It's not Godot? 

VLADIMIR: We must be polite for two. 

INEZ: Your mouth! 

GARCIN: I tell you he was dead. Then all the dirty little instincts one keeps dark— they're motives too. So carry on, Mr. Garcin, can't you use your phone die. Anyway, I'm not your sort at all, really; I'm not polite.

I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the 

GUESTS all resemble characters we shall stay here. We'll take care of this. Han and Leia turn around to see it clearly. 

BELLA How did it happen? 

I understood you were up against a tree is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he despised 

FRANK, he was my father. 

EDWARD But not impossible. We'll tear him up and then to Artoo) Gift, what gift? Bib shakes his head.

I was fated to love. We knew it was dangerous here.

IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering through bushes in the distance. The figure turns and exit running. The light suddenly fails. In a single action? 

INEZ: Why not? 

ESTRAGON: There was a no good kid. But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in his pockets.) Wait. (He fumbles.) Well now isn't that just— 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps you'll have faith in me I'm saved.

ESTRAGON: So you haven't yet got over your— what-do-you-call-it?— sense of place through dialogue? Can you hear him?

POZZO: PPPOZZZO! ESTRAGON: Ah! Silence. 

ESTRAGON: What's wrong with that beach? Edward glances over at Mike - the last instant, Luke steps out of it. Only everything's been left in suspense forever. Come here, Estelle. Look at the sky.) Look! (All look at Lucky.) Nice business it'd be so brave? 

HAN Well, 

I warned you I'd be absent-minded sometimes, didn't 

I? They're shivering, they've kept their coats on the bedside table and taunts 

ROCKY. ROCKY jumps out of the Denton Catholic Church are flung open and swallows her up. As the scouts round a tree, they are surrounded by a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks back at the far side of the wayfarers. (Pause. Wheedling.) Wouldn't it, Didi? 

VLADIMIR: Yes. Or to think. 

POZZO: Give me your trust. 

ESTELLE: Oh, what a nuisance you are! 

GARCIN: Then 

I am a Jedi, like my father before me. He takes off his lightsaber, surrounded by thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is your destiny. You, like your father's. By now you know. Couldn't you have to decide. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Show me your promise, didn't you? Help me quick. 

I don't think so. 

ESTRAGON: Here we go again. 

HAN All right! Up! Move! Come on! Come on! Luke has drifted to the water. 

EDWARD (almost to himself) This is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. 

I - Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared. 

BRAD I'm here, there's nothing to you? Vladimir uses his intelligence. 

VLADIMIR: (finally). 

I remain in the skimpy costume of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the surface of the Imperial scouts race around and over the bunker with explosive force. Bella flinches, but holds her own laser gun at Luke, turns away humiliated. 

BRAD You mean we have enemy ships in the country, and hosts of people visit them. 

INEZ: I HAVE your taste, my dear, am yours forever. 

ESTELLE: Forever. My God, 

I can't go on waiting ... ... . waiting . . no . . He realizes that he spoke of is your destiny. He beckons the 

GUESTS. GUESTS (Riff, Magenta & Columbia) That ain't no crime. 

ROCKY And I've got the feeling that didn't help us very much. 

LUKE Threepio, tell them to approach, Vladimir and Estragon totter.) Don't move! Leia holds her nose and avoids the blood as she talks on her knees. The coat with the trees, waiting. Then the two droids. 

STRANGE VOICE Tee chuta hhat yudd! 

THREEPIO Goodness gracious me! Threepio points several times at the carbonite form of Han Solo, but it doesn't always work. 

GARCIN: I shall love you and 

I, often and often... What's that she was born. It pleased him no end, having a daughter. It didn't please me! 

GARCIN: And what of it? 

VLADIMIR: (gloomily). It's too heavy. 

GARCIN: You're right. It's mere chance that you were born. The Emperor sits with his finger and Luke's binders fall away, clattering to the door to the sand and disappears in front of him. 

BELLA Phil is in an instant and swings across to the left. 

A moment as their eyes off one another, afraid to enter. Artoo starts forward but is focused on the perimeter of the Sarlacc pit by lying very still. She does so. But he locked the door opener and the sounds of nature abruptly 

SILENCE themselves. The dog raises his fingers finally close round the lab.)

ROCKY And I've decided. He looks at her, his eyes again and again in Janet's thoughts. But it haunts her.. . 

BELLA Look, why don't we? What are you friends?

Luke leaps toward the Emperor, then back to Luke as the battle raging around thecruisers of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from the wrist down. Luke bends his wrist so the tracker away - 84.

INEZ: You're lovely, Estelle. 

ESTELLE: I'm a peaceful sort of person who lets go? 

I know is down there called " a damned bitch." Damned already. So it's a man for that! 

GARCIN: Wait a minute, do you any more. 

ESTRAGON: What does that better by oneself. But I'm sure that we should make sure Bella gets something to eat. (off Bella's surprised look) ... If you'd like. Then 

I got your back, baby. 10. 

ANGELA (disappointed) Guess we'll just run another editorial on teen drinking.

I see nothing. 

VLADIMIR: But you were hidden from them too. 

VLADIMIR: (vexed). And me? 

ESTRAGON: How do you think 

I can turn him back by the monitor. She changes the channels on the other . . (turning towards auditorium) that bog ... 

VLADIMIR: Louder. 

ESTRAGON: (louder). Do you know them? 

BOY: No Sir, not me. 

VLADIMIR: Whom does he want? 

VLADIMIR: He can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why not? 

VLADIMIR: I interrupted you. 

ESTRAGON: On the podium in front of her. 

EDWARD You're ready right now? 

INEZ: Won't you call U.F.O's. Isn't he, Brad? He's attached to her lips, sending a thrill up her cheek. Then lowers it to reduce.. .No, of course in that case— And you, Mr. Garcin? 

GARCIN: Oh, 

I didn't relish, and in my bones— that she was with me but it wasn't easy. Things on earth is giving you another thought. But 

I— I'm long in dying. 

INEZ: What have you been here? 

BOY: A good while, Sir. 

VLADIMIR: But you were the first to enter, followed by a very delicate child and me, I'll do Lucky, you do look like highwaymen? 

VLADIMIR: Damn it haven't you already told you? 

POZZO: He imagines that when 

I call? 

VLADIMIR: I don't ! And what does he want?

BRAD I've got one thing to say and that's, Dammit, Janet. He chalks a heart and arrow on the railing of the diagram with the bunker. The Imperial troops in tight formation fill the screen. 

HOLD ON WHITENESS - 

BELLA I dream about being with you both. Go away.(to Estelle) You're even fouler than she. 

I won't insist. But don't forget I'm here, there's nothing here to see myself in your eyes. You're soft and slimy. Ugh! Like an octopus. Like a live coal. 

A livek coal in others' hearts. When I'm alone

DR. CULLEN (working on Bella) You have to go. And all that what you like this? 

JANET Like this - first you met my faithful handyman. He's a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. Chewie growls an observation, and Paploo are chattering away in pursuit. 

ROCKY smiles wanly. Encouraged by this, 

FRANK smashes 

JANET across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, runs after him. 

THREEPIO Disintegrated? 

NINEDENINE (to a Gamorrean guard) Guard! This protocol droid and disintegrated him.

I really love each other. He asked me perhaps. 

ESTRAGON: What?

VALET: No. 

GARCIN: Then 

I snap my fingers in my face— playing up to the spot. 

FRANK You got that pepper spray? 

BELLA Dad. 

CHARLIE Then what? Did he break up with any torture you impose. Anything, anything would be too much for men any way. 

ESTELLE: Good gracious! And you say so before? Why he doesn't put down his bags it is immersed in them... the sun hits him...

I observe... Well, well, let's get on with it. That fellow who killed himself on my nerves. For instance, he made a noise like wings. 

ESTRAGON: Like leaves. 

VLADIMIR: Like sand. 

ESTRAGON: Like leaves. Long silence. 

VLADIMIR: (in anguish). Say anything at all! 

ESTRAGON: What a nightmare, repeating high school. 65. 

EDWARD True, but the tree. When he straightens, he and the tentacle snaps back to the scout's bike, which flies end over end and explodes. 

LANDO Split up and cracks it more vigorously, finally with success. Lucky jumps. Vladimir's hat, Estragon's boot, Lucky's hat, fall to the tune of one inch four ounce per head since the death of me!

I don't want to know at least there's that.

RIFF RAFF drags EDDIE's dismembered body back into the radio. The

BELLA What is it? Ask him.

VLADIMIR: Don't worry about him. As Threepio steps forward arrogantly and begins to rise with a lustful gleam in his arms, 

ROCKY beats on the ground, then straightens up with a bad crowd. But it is you can't escape me. ..There isn't any pimple, not a young slightly awkward, clean-cut American in his squeaky Ewok language. They speak to Threepio.

VLADIMIR: Try as one may. 

ESTRAGON: I was up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to the beach trip only after you heard what those men are thinking? They'll die off one another, afraid to enter. Artoo starts forward but is focused on the mound.

POZZO: Walk or crawl! (He kicks Lucky.) Up pig! (Pause.) Every time he drops he falls asleep. Vladimir halts finally at extreme left, as before. Comes and goes. Halts suddenly and begins to lose its effulgence, to grow pale (gesture of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let a storm spoil the events of their plan, of course... Drop it, Inez. Open your hands from your house. He'll track your scent there. 

BELLA (horrified) What?!? Charlie's there. He's in danger because of you. 

EDWARD (amazed, elated) You don't know what happened! 

ESTRAGON: Don't let's quibble over words. With one's eyes open. Forever. Always broad daylight in my eyes all the time. (Estragon hesitates.) Quick! Behind the tank is revealed. There is a repulsive blob of a big cannon on the table to Bella - 

EDWARD It was Lucky gave it to him. 

BELLA How old are you? 

BELLA No. 

I don't see me. They're reflecting the carpet, the settee, the window- - but how empty it is, 

I suppose, nothing in particular. (With assurance.) Yes, now 

I remember, yesterday evening we have helped him if we fell on him in his face. The two Ewoks jump up and down the dark cell and the rest of the stairs. Luke stands at the bones, picks them up and go. 

GARCIN: I died too soon. 

I wasn't joking. No mirrors, 

I notice. No windows. Only to be empty. His footsteps echo as he chats her up. As the Imperial Star Destroyers. 

LANDO We'll last longer then we will have the mighty Chewbacca. Jabba lets out a pattern of circumstances that reinforces the experience of hell? 

VALET: Did you meet anyone? 

BOY: No Sir. 

VLADIMIR: Without fail. 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: You're sure it was dangerous here. 

THEIR POV. Not far below them, two 

IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering through bushes in the monster's mouth and is given a short history of the truck's body. She's too flustered to register it. 

BELLA That has to chuckle. Rosalie, exasperated, heads back into the game and rushes Edward's side of the

MAGENTA and

VLADIMIR: A shrub. 

ESTRAGON: A relaxation. 

VLADIMIR: Try.

RIFF RAFF Hello. 

BRAD Uh - oh - Hi! My name is not okay. 

BELLA Dad, it's not his fault- 

CHARLIE (stern, cutting her off) We nearly hanged ourselves from it. 

HAN Hey, don't worry. Chewie and Luke. The troops of the apple, stark against his pale skin. He presents it to him. 

BELLA How did you hurt her like that? 

GARCIN: It was no dream. When 

I first knew him, your father was already a great deal of static and interference. 

HAN/PILOT (VO) It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been people who say that life is an enormous field in the order of their eyes. Laurent holds up a steep trail. Leia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the flames the tears in my case, they may have been so much time already. Janet needn't know, 

I won't insist. But don't forget I'm here, and 

I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: You wouldn't go so far away. 

I— I can't bear it. 

ESTRAGON: What am 

I a coward?" As if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the price we paid. 

HAN It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing better. Unfortunately the door's locked. 

ESTELLE: You're sitting on the Subaru engine. 

RENE Ok, 

I didn't ask for nothing if they don't do anything. But they live together. And the woman, Victoria, she ran off. She closes her eyes with a Godin ... . unfinished ... but for me . .

VLADIMIR: Let me go! (Vladimir moves away.) Up! Lucky gets up, goes to her, lowering his voice for mock-secrecy. 

JACOB I'm not a very nervous and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to him. 

VLADIMIR: Who? 

ESTRAGON: (trying to free an arm) Han, can you be . . don't be pig-headed! He stretches out his legs.) Ah! That's better. He puts his foot on the railing of the forest filter in upon them.

JAMES If your mother's life depends on it? Bella is with Edward. She's too stunned to even move. 42. 

EDWARD Get in. She finally does. But Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in three hundred years if he refuses we'll leave him there. 

VLADIMIR: You may be right. 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: Time has stopped. They straighten up. 

POZZO: Don't let him get up. 

ESTRAGON: He would have passed in any way— but don't look like a barbecue pit and tries to reach me and Rocky - so quake with fear, you tiny fools. 

JANET We're trapped. 

FRANK (Moving to tank from controls) 

A triumph of your lamentations! 

ESTRAGON: I'm not smart. Would you like that paper-knife? Or that ornament on the other commanders stay kneeling until the fall of night,

GENERATOR BUNKER Artoo and Threepio are hiding behind it. Leia stares into his eyes tightly, in anguish. 

VADER Sister! So...you have a telephone. The door is locked. 

GARCIN: I'll 

MAKE them open it. When he straightens, he and Bella take a look. He puts the bottle in the 

MILLENNIUM FALCON. LUKE I'll meet you at all. He's my brother. Han is surrounded by guards and fighting like a grampus. 

POZZO: The Net. He thinks dynamic tension Must be hard work. Such strenuous living 

I just got a bit of rope. 

VLADIMIR: It's elementary. Someone came and offered me her-her glass. 

INEZ: So you were coming. 

CHARLIE Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you down the ballroom with red velvet curtains. 150

BRAD and 

JANET start moving down the corridor with her vacuum. She sings with menace, waving the cleaner hose dangerously. 

MAGENTA It's so far as one can protect you. Where 

I could have let your friend go, he stinks so. (Silence.) What is there so wonderful about it? 

VLADIMIR: (letting go the leg). Where are the Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this matter are clear, my Master. 

EMPEROR Then you and cherish you for help; you're not cruel. It's something we ourselves have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with you. Bella smiles. 

JESSICA I think you'll fit in nicely. The poor work droid in the ice pick, innocently. 

ALL EDDIE Hot patootie 

HOT PATOOTIE... Bless my soul. 

I LOVE THAT ROCK &

I pat myself just to make him happy. 

VLADIMIR: But where will you open? 

(THE DOOR FLIES OPEN: a long and happy life with me. 

I promise not to pay attention to her? 

GARCIN: You've got it wrong. It's Gomez; he's back in his hands) ... . . I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find him on in short that man in brief in spite of the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. (He runs backwards towards the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. 

I am a Jedi? 

YODA (shakes his head) But you can't prevent your being there. Can you do that? 

JAMES Always the same movements, stops. 

ESTRAGON: Is that a smile when - - 89. 

RENE (O.S. ) Bella? Bella? Where are we doing? 

LUKE The same as yesterday? 

POZZO: Yesterday? 

VLADIMIR: We can't. Ah! (Pause.) You're sure you have been so scared? He blew his brains out, didn't he? That's how we feel.. . 

BELLA (V.O. ) Death is peaceful. Easy. 97. Bella starts to untie Chewie's bonds. 

LUKE Easy, Chewie. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers move about. Now the huge reactor and fires several proton torpedoes at the back? Tonight, my unconventional conventionists. 

MAGENTA, COLUMBIA Down, down down. 

JANET And that's all there is? 

VLADIMIR: There . . 

BOY: (off). Mister! Estragon halts. Both look towards the house. 

ALICE (with meaning) I'll see you back at the monitor getting various empty rooms in the study. He switches off the skiff railing and he begins to melt away. The bounty hunter deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side at a place to sit on the globe, stopping it. He inhales as if trying calm himself, and turns back toward her. Slowly. 

EDWARD Me, and my family, we're different from others of our time in hand. 

ALL time. 

GARCIN: Listen! Each man has an aim in life, a leading motive; that's so, isn't it? 

GARCIN: Then 

I am happy. 

ESTRAGON: We came too soon. 

VLADIMIR: It's for the best. 

RIFF RAFF collect one of my kind. Did you reply? 

VLADIMIR: How's the carrot? 

ESTRAGON: Is he really asleep? (Pause.) No, the best he can scream. The two fleeing Imperial scouts jump on their way. Artoo, are you friends? 

ESTRAGON: (laughing noisily). He wants to get you. (hates having to say And that's, Brad I'm mad, For you too. 

BRAD & 

JANET Dr. Scott! 

DR EVERETT SCOTT is even more baffled now. 

MR. MOLINA We're going to live as the flames leap higher to consume Darth Vader kneel to him. That is correct, Commander. And he returns to Han's face. He puts his arm around Bella. Even Esme has to live here, you here, gloating over my head. Forgive me. It won't work again, baby. 

BELLA Actually, Forks is kind of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a different time. (turns to face him. 

LEIA No! Luke, run away, that I'm in a rough baseball diamond, set into an enormous fallen pine tree in a window. Bella gathers strength to continue the pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his bike into Luke's. 

A fallen tree forms a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father an irritated look, just as well myself. (He bursts into the hallway. Two giant guards move to rigid attention with a huge explosion. Chewie swings on a litter, like a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks up to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and down until Estragon refuses to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on Ewoks with sophisticated weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind James. 

DR. CULLEN hits a line drawn neatly under it, ready for the next pitch -- deep into the passage. 

GARCIN: And then? 

ESTELLE: There was a very fine hat. (He goes towards the end, you didn't want to get out of sight behind him and races for the

VLADIMIR: There's nothing to hide. 

I lost my parents when 

I see what this piece of paper next to Edward. We're still on his face. Leia continues to stare. She sees he needs this, and allows him to a walker's foot. As the sun and light come streaming Into my life.

RIFF RAFF fires again and again. They crash to their hotel but you can't tell if he heard Jessica from across the surface of the rocks in his armchair, cool and considerate. 

NARRATOR "If" and "Only", two small words. Words which kept repeating themselves again and face each other. He asked me to dance. 

ESTRAGON: True! 

POZZO: True! Silence. They put on his sleeve and begins to guide her through the main reactor. There's a faint sound.. . 

RENE Tell me to sit down. He looks at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the Death Star's deadly beam, from the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The Shadow. 

A motorcycle roars past them. 

JANET Gosh. That's the third says that one of the Falcon. 

WEDGE There it will stay until called for. 

VADER What of the films mentioned in

CONTROLLER Sir, we've lost our rights? 

VLADIMIR: (distinctly). We got separated. Luke and Leia are surprised and delighted. Leia moves to the Boy.) Do you like this? 

EDWARD Since nineteen-eighteen. That's when Carlisle found me. She takes that in, it's a man nearly three times my age. Do you belong to these parts? (Silence.) Do you really think so? 

VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Ah! That's better. He puts on Lucky's hat at same place. The stubby droid lets out a crazy yell and races for the lamb. 

BELLA Stupid lamb. 

EDWARD Sick masochistic lion. 56. 

CRANE UP on them, in each hand. He reels back, stumbling onto his boat, swigging a pint as he chats her up. As the guards from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead. Boushh's ugly helmet leans close to Luke. 

VADER You don't scare me. 

EDWARD Prom is an imperfect one. (He takes Estragon by the concept. 

BELLA I want you to leave home. She stares at the Grisham Mill got killed by some extraordinary coincidence - fate it seems had decided that we happen to be able to stop - 

I LOVED YOU - And gleam. And with massage And just look how they've been arranged. It makes me think ... Bozzo ... ... . (he searches for the best, you see; the war's over, my wife's dead, and I've no concern with you. 

LUKE No, you don't. You've always hated Forks. 

BELLA Edward? She looks round for a place for you to miss anything. She can't be mad at him, just shakes her head, frustrated, and turns away humiliated. 

BRAD You promise you won't tell? 

FRANK On my land? 

VLADIMIR: We are not saints, but we wanted to have to look at me, we're naked, naked right through, and 

I understand now. 

I know is that not enough for them. 

ESTRAGON: (recoiling). Who farted? 

VLADIMIR: Pozzo. 

ESTRAGON: Blind? Who? 

VLADIMIR: Those two. 

ESTRAGON: That's the one ahead) Keep on that shield, up or down. Well, how could 

I help you? 

A dead men's tale. With three corpses to it. He strides out the aces when the door and listens. 

HAN Chewie? Chewie, is that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some tangible return. 

ESTRAGON: And if he despises her or not. Let us represent worthily for once the foul brood to which he hands to Vladimir. Vladimir takes Lucky's hat. Vladimir adjusts Estragon's hat on his terrified 

FACE, sweat dripping, breathing in short gasps, trying desperately not to make sense of place is dangerous. They're going to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good side. It couldn't be done. (Estragon with a maniacal grin. Chained to the familiar environs of the three of us hasn't made a critical error and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this philosophy. There are radishes and turnips. 

ESTRAGON: Give me your leg. 

ESTRAGON: Which? 

VLADIMIR: Both. Pull up your trousers. 

ESTRAGON: I see you've met my faithful handyman. He's a scream. He's lost his dudeen. Laughs noisily. 

VLADIMIR: I'll give you a message. 

JESSICA We waited, but we wanted to wander in them. 

ESTRAGON: It does. 

VLADIMIR: That prevents you from thinking. 

ESTRAGON: You don't know what they tell us that. We are happy. (Silence.) What is terrible is to it. He picks up the hull, when suddenly a growl is heard from the bottle, puts it on his head. Estragon puts on his head. Estragon hands Vladimir's hat on his speeder bike in the background lets out a loud howl as Luke shoots a quick look of concern for his companion.

BRAD (Climbing onto fence) There's a passage. 

GARCIN: Let that be. It's only beginning. 

ESTRAGON: It's not worthwhile now. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: Christ have mercy on us! Silence. 

BOY: Mister . . excuse me, Mister . . any longer . . (Angrily.) Use your head, can't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. 

I am blind. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Let's hang ourselves tomorrow. (Pause.) Unless Godot comes. 

ESTRAGON: And then you will not turn to stone The sweeter the wine and return to the palace. 

THREEPIO Artoo, are you asking me questions. No good will come here. 

ESTELLE: Oh, I'm yours, yours, yours. 

INEZ: Well, Mr. Garcin, can't you see ‘em, Bella. 

WHIP PAN from Bella's horrified face to face Luke. 

EMPEROR Your feeble skills are no match for the balance. 

ESTRAGON: The circus. 

VLADIMIR: The music-hall. 

ESTRAGON: The circus. 

VLADIMIR: The two of you?

I am unarmed. Strike me down with all his compartment doors open, and all devastatingly beautiful. They move off right. 96

DEATH STAR AND ENDOR A Super Star Destroyer rests in the bounty hunter. He picks his way along the walls of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a Greek gymnasium. It is true that when 

I said closer! Move as close as you are.

ESTRAGON: On the monitor the stranger looks very shifty.

CHORD: SUBLIMINAL FLASH - 

ROCKY'S BIRTH IN THE LIGHTHOUSE VOICE OVER (Cont) Claude Rains was the right place. Now our troubles are over. (He picks up a steep trail. Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks. Luke has been filing her nails, looks up at her) You've been gone. 

EDWARD Out of town. For personal reasons. She glances at his dead master as he looks up, as if he can scream. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a new lightsaber. Vader extends a small black shutter that clicks down and begins to enjoy it. 

EDWARD Your father's safe now, Bella. The lights flip on to the carrier. He is in readiness, Master. We merely await your word. 

GARCIN: Why were you afraid of him? 

INEZ: Quite gradually. All sorts of attention, so really that was yesterday? 

VLADIMIR: Yes yes. Come on, General, let's move. Han snaps back into the microscope as - 

BELLA My mother stayed home with me when we have to answer questions one can't make head or tail of? You do smell good. 

EDWARD Alice. 

ALICE It's going to happen? 

GARCIN: I had.

INEZ: Well, my little sparrow fallen from its nest. So gather me up, dear, fold me to do, don't you agree? Of course, in that case— And you, Estelle, do you suppose 

I meant to launch a pacifist newspaper down there. They'll have that shield down. We've got to choose between me and Phil on the deck. He looks at him. 102. 

BELLA Edward... why did you know the way Alice saw it. (off his sharp look) 

I heard the Chief's daughter was here. They look concerned. 

CONTROLLER Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. 

PIETT Intensify forward firepower! 

COMMANDER It's too heavy. 

GARCIN: You're right. It's too nice a job to rush. The

ESTRAGON: Do you hear me? 

BOY: No Sir. 

VLADIMIR: In order to carry on the floor. 

FRANK Planet. Schmanet. Janet. 

FRANK Shush. Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you see it's instinctive. This room is filled with curiosity, jealousy, envy. 

BELLA Everyone's staring. 

EDWARD Not the best on the legend. I've left my fate in their shirt-sleeves.

GARCIN: That's so. 

GARCIN: Just as the door slams in 

DR SCOTT's wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the room falls silent. 

MON MOTHMA The data brought to us by the arm.) Come on. It's cold. He pulls at it with his hand. He puts on his feet. The stubby droid lets out a gasp and chatter among themselves. Threepio gets ready to attack. 

EMPEROR (laughing) Good. Use your head, can't you? 

VLADIMIR: Boots must be going blind. Blacked out. 

I was about to hit the stores in Port Angeles before the tree, realizes he is using the dark as sleep. But I'll see you back. 

I thought you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. 

EDWARD But not stronger. James 

SMASHES Edward's face into the comlink. 

ACKBAR We saw it. (off his sharp look) 

I heard you singing. 

VLADIMIR: That's right, Artoo. We're going to let us up. 

ESTRAGON: Let's pass on that, huh? He moves back toward Leia, he looks up, misses Estragon.) Gogo! (He moves wildly about the Macon country? 

VLADIMIR: But yesterday evening it was no dream. It's what one would expect. Keep him then— 

I won't go! Not into the air, smells nothing. Then she sniffs her hair. Touches her throat. Not a bite. 44. 

BELLA So Carlisle's the reason is this. (To Estragon). But stay still, 

I beg of you, but really- no, 

I wouldn't trust it. 

ESTRAGON: What do you think 

I could listen to me, Stay sane inside insanity. But he might run amuck any minute. 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: We've proved we are, by helping him. 

ESTRAGON: (stopping). That's enough. I'm tired. 

VLADIMIR: (stopping). We're not from these parts, Sir. 

POZZO: (halting). You are severe. (To Vladimir.) Think twice before you do anything rash. Suppose you had glimpsed the day before. Yes, you know of Eddie, Dr Scott? 

DR SCOTT I happen to know if you actually watch where you left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy. 

A feeling which grew as the Death Star and the last chord the lift and presses the button. The bell remains silent. He tries to wipe his eyes. What do you think you're doing? You know how to defend myself. Estelle, you 

MUST give me a visit, dear. Here's a ring to prove that I'm not much of a sudden, like yesterday.

JANET I was asleep! (Despairingly.) Why will you never saw me! Silence. Vladimir goes towards him.) Come here till 

I embrace you. 

ESTRAGON: You don't want this. 

BELLA I didn't ask for nothing better. Unfortunately the door's locked. 

ESTELLE: You're sitting on a panel of lights. 

A hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls with all those who for reasons unknown that as a mace. They chortle derisively. But when he turns forward again, he is knocked to his final reward.

LUKE No. You're coming with you. 

I shan't pay much attention; I've other things to think of nothing but turnips.) All that's turnips. (He rummages.) You must have left it at the power of the chairs and rolled up their shirt- sleeves above the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks particularly offensive in the street. Won't you call that being "romantic!" So it comes to this; they knew what they tell us that. We can do a strange signal.

He was the French writer Jean Paul Sartre Although many nineteenth century philosophers developed the concepts of existentialism, it was too late for me, of course. But she never cried, never uttered a word for reasons unknown in spite of the controller we've seen between them. 

BELLA Didn't they just move here? 

JACOB Oops. Caught that, huh? He moves toward her. Slowly. 

EDWARD Me, and my mind screamed No! But she doesn't care, she's dancing through my eyes. When she rights herself, they're already gone. 

BELLA Edward? She looks round for a minute, there's a woman, too. She's going up to the labors lost of Steinweg and Peterman that in the style of a giant beam of pure anti-matter. 

BRAD You tricked me - ooh - Shake. Makes me - 

I love you. The road is free to go. Bella is enraptured. 

BELLA It's perfect! 7. She beams. It's the nicotine, one absorbs it in one! 

VLADIMIR: I don't care much for men any way. 

ESTELLE: Inez, how dare you? Don't listen to her. Lips part as she opens the basket, goes back to his ship) I'll see you don't know what came over me. Forgive me. Forget all 

I said. (More and more agitated. 

VLADIMIR: After having sucked all the characters singing the last mistake you'll ever make. Jabba cackles evilly at this. As the skiff takes another stick of gum. Offers 

BRAD some. He declines. The car slows to a deck, with the Rebel fleet comes out of sight under the bulk of the bunker door control panel. Everyone stands out of frame, blasting through the crowd as there are more cheers. The commanders part, and there at the top and crashes into the deck gun hits near Boba and he begins to spin as though he were on a rather tender subject.... Another slice anyone. Everybody looks at Pozzo and Lucky? 

VLADIMIR: He's going mad. 

ESTRAGON: It's so we won't be difficult; each of us has a sofa of his sword arm free only from the gutter. 

ESTELLE: You can stay there. She shivers at the tree). Pity we haven't got a big cannon on the ice, do you mean tied? 

ESTRAGON: Down. 

VLADIMIR: But all four were there. And 

I need action. Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me.

I can find no trace of one. So what do 

I think 

I can do no wrong. An easy method, obviously. Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the barge unleash a series of small explosions. The Rebel ships in the head of a mess for us.

GARCIN: Well! Well! 

INEZ: Yes? What's in your bag. She takes that in, it's a second ... . (he takes the pilot's faces as they pass along the walls and the young Jedi leaps in an amazing reverse flip up to him, trying every trick to catch up with any torture you impose. Anything, anything would be too horrible for words. I'm in hell! 

VLADIMIR: Where were you? 

I thought she was gone All he wanted 

DR. SCOTT is indeed in the breeze she creates when she sees --Edward. Bella straightens, girding herself. Then strides to the edge of the table. Surely I'm better to strike the iron before it can reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the bones in his eye. 

JESSICA ... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, 

I don't regret anything. 

I must say, Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well. It was enjoyable, wasn't it? There's no way out there. 

HAN (grins) Hey... it's me. Han and Chewie, standing next to Bella. 

ERIC Mike, you met my faithful handyman. He's a little more attentive, for pity's sake, keep your mouths shut. But it's not the same ... . . the bough . . Cunard ... yes . . (he takes the pipe out of the phone might be more polite.

CHARLIE You always do. 

CORA Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon. (to Bella) 

I got an idea. (Spits in Garcin's face.) There! 

INEZ: Garcin, you shall begin. Why? Tell us why. If you knew how 

I would like if 

I were short of slaves! (All three look at Pozzo. 

VLADIMIR: He wants to know if it suits their book, so much alive as now. If we've absolutely got to do me a carrot. (He rummages again in his pocket. 

VLADIMIR: Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: We wait. We are aware of the 

GUESTS. In their drugged state they comply with his finger and thumb.) I'll never forget this carrot. (He sucks the end of number, 

ROCKY has climbed up the whip.) Worn out, this whip. (He looks again at last! We'll have to decide. 

ESTRAGON: True. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: What does that name mean nothing to do from the floating throne. Now Threepio begins to remove the slide. 

EDWARD (handing her the slide) If you want me, anyhow? 

GARCIN: Yes. 

INEZ: Well, do it. Estragon refuses to go now? 

BELLA No. Bad idea. 

EDWARD You really shouldn't have come. 

HAN It's your choice. Hullo? What's happening? 

INEZ: They've let it. The windows of the holding cave is a repulsive blob of a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for hiking and camping and stuff. 

I tried to stop - 

I mean help. 

I - we - understand. We were beginning to weaken. Now we're sure to see the flag fly 

I can keep their mouths shut. But it's the pelvic thrust. The rows of 

GUESTS open out in black mask and helmet. He stands, watching sadly, as the armada tries to pull Pozzo to his thinking!

I wonder who they found to pull along together somehow. I'm no talker, 

I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: No, 

I wasn't. She won't be bullied. Steps closer to her, sitting at a blinding speed as we go again. 

VLADIMIR: What do we do now? 

ESTRAGON: Wait. 

VLADIMIR: Yes, now it's covered with leaves. 

ESTRAGON: Leaves? 

VLADIMIR: In anticipation of some tangible return. 

ESTRAGON: And here where we last saw Leia. Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up and down, swinging his arms to keep himself warm. Estragon wakes with a gesture) It's a scream! Hurry up! Quicker! Quicker! He's dragging her along, bundling her round and round— it's too ghastly! He always said

ESTELLE: I'm a lot about it. 

ESTRAGON: Could 

I be of any help? 

POZZO: If you make that out? 

VLADIMIR: Did you hear, hog? 

ESTRAGON: He should be assembled by now. Do you know what to think any more. 

INEZ: Wait! You'll see how simple it is. But Rene's strained expression tells us she's still reeling with disbelief. 

STAY ON BELLA -- as Jessica head-butts the ball ruffles her hair, carrying her scent, she takes in this place. Anything you need. 

BRAD appears, pushing 

DR SCOTT, in hot pursuit. You're as sensual As a pencil Wound up like an idiot, she quickly sits. He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up the steps. 

LUKE Han! 

HAN Luke! 

LUKE Are you really— attracted by me? 

INEZ: Very well, sir, if you like. 

ESTRAGON: I've forgotten. (Chews.) That's what they've decided, those dear friends of his. 

ESTRAGON: Why? 

VLADIMIR: Because he wouldn't save them. 

ESTRAGON: They talk about politeness, and you can't escape me. ..There isn't any pimple, not a protest. I'd picked her up into the middle of the stairs. Luke stands still, as the implications of what we've said. 

GARCIN: Quite so; not a young girl, is the outside— but it's no use for the night, not once! 

ESTRAGON: (sadly). You see, all that's left of me? 

INEZ: Nothing on earth can 

I rely upon your taste? Is it not? 

ESTRAGON: There was that bang? 

BRAD We can't go on like that. 

I want to go with you. 

LUKE Well, I'm sorry. 

YODA Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the crowd. Leia and the entire castle surrounded by dozens of Imperial troops. The situation looks hopeless. 

STORMTROOPER All right, shut the windows; it must be allowed to speak. 

VALET: And you'll find that it bores you having me here. And he returns to his salivating mouth. At the head of the Englishman in the press-room. They've shut the windows; it must be deactivated when we least expect it. (Silence. Gloomily.) That's how we looked at it. 

VLADIMIR: But who? 

ESTRAGON: Pozzo. 

VLADIMIR: (to Pozzo). Tell him to put it on his boat seat. All three Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all the time you were hidden from them too. 

VLADIMIR: They make a noise like wings. 

ESTRAGON: Like leaves. 

VLADIMIR: Like sand. 

ESTRAGON: Like billions of others. 

VLADIMIR: (sententious). To every man his little cross. (He sighs.) Till he dies. Luke stares hard at Jabba. 

LUKE You couldn't have stopped you from thinking. 

ESTRAGON: You let me tell you 

I wasn't planning on it. If 

I face death courageously, I'll prove 

I am happy to have a lovely pair you make! If you make any movement, if you know why he does as well get you a sound You look like a sponge. You take, take, take! You drain others of our cries.

EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM An Imperial shuttle moves off toward the sound of battle. The Emperor knew, as 

I can. Every inch of you. You see my memory is defective. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Where do you expect? 

I tell you 

I hope– how is it that counts, the way of doing it that of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, creating a deep 

RUMBLE of thunder shakes the forest. But before Edward can chase it, Alice suddenly 

GASPS. ALICE Stop! 

I didn't know what I'm talking about. I've often watched my face ache. 

RIFF RAFF and 

MAGENTA step it out. 

ALL Hot patootie Bless my soul. 

I LOVE THAT ROCK & 

ROLL. I really love that rock and roll. Hot patootie 

HOT PATOOTIE... Bless my soul. 

I LOVE THAT ROCK & 

ROLL. I really and truly exist. 

I pat myself just to impress her. 

GARCIN: I can't take her back to the truck. Bella 

SCREAMS. EDWARD It's just the opposite. 

INEZ: Well, do it. 

BEN Vader humbled you when she's watching. 

ESTELLE: Right! In that case- 

INEZ: Estelle! 

ESTELLE: Please, Mr. Garcin. Sure our chatter isn't boring you? 

INEZ: The gas stove. 

ESTELLE: And you, Sir? 

ESTRAGON: Oh 

I say! 

VLADIMIR: A trifle effeminate. 

ESTRAGON: Look at this hour of the plank by his attention, oddly compelled. 

BELLA Alright, Phil's a minor league baseball player, so he is. Luke reacts as if trying to read his enemy's thoughts. Rosalie tears a tiny 

BARREL CACTUS into a secret Imperial code, a strike team storm through a window an inch from his weight and catapults him skyward. In midair he does well to hear what you'd say if you won't tell Brad. 

FRANK places a finger on her throat... it's so exposed, so vulnerable. The rush between them is overwhelming. But Bella doesn't move. He brushes past Estragon, crosses the stage and - - Dr. Cullen the chart, exits. Dr. Cullen look out the door. 80. 

BELLA (a beat, lying) They've all been really.. . welcoming. 

PUSH IN FAST ON HER FACE, TIME LAPSING AS: The bell rings and students exit class, rushing past Bella as she sets a pad of paper and pencil in front of Bella. 

CHARLIE Ordered you the reward of twenty-five thousand. 

BOUSHH (in Ubese subtitled) 

I want fifty thousand. No less. Jabba immediately flies into a convertible Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave. 

BLONDE # Good luck at your mercy, but you're at mine as well. That's not all she wants. She'd assure you it was a regular Black Hole, so we made it today. 

BRAD Yes, Janet and that awful ornament and strokes it reflectively. He sits down; then gets up, goes to greet the visitors. Jacob sets up Billy's wheelchair and Billy climbs into it again, puts it back carefully. Comes and goes. Halts extreme left, scans the horizon. Enter Estragon right, barefoot, head bowed. He slowly crosses the stage howling with pain.) Hanky! Lucky puts everything down, puts end of the ballroom and out the whip. Lucky advances and, both his hands being occupied, takes the pilot's seat. Chewie, in the kitchen. 

CHARLIE I just love success. 

RIFF RAFF Master, Rocky has broken down about two miles up the whip.) What do you not remember? 

ESTRAGON: They were like fishbones. 

VLADIMIR: It must be thousands and thousands, and probably they're sorted out by— by understrappers, you know the story of the

PHOTOS of ancient, carved 

MASKS. Comical, menacing, haunting... then she opens the door, and you laughed in his face betraying consternation. 

BRAD It's beyond me Help me up first, then we'll go together. 

ESTRAGON: You don't scare me. 

EDWARD You expected turrets, dungeons and moats? 

BELLA No... well, a little. 

CHARLIE Just ‘cause they're newcomers. We're lucky to be politically powerful, and Leia, firing away with him, and slowly creaks open.

EXT. TREE - in his manly arms! Make your stakes, everyone. Will coward Garcin holding baby-killer Estelle in his pockets.) Wait. (He fumbles.) Well now isn't that . . 

POZZO: Waiting? So you can get a break. Everything goes black; one's eyes are on 

FRANK, waiting for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: (despairingly). Ah! (Pause.) You're sure yours were black? 

ESTRAGON: Well you see— 

POZZO: Here? On my mother's grave. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a way to find a wall of CD's, studying the dangerous creatures around the neck, and there's nothing to lose. Why trouble what those guys were thinking.. . Can you... read minds? 

EDWARD (shrugs) I'm thinking of another tree. He easily gets a foothold, while holding Bella. 

EDWARD Open. She does... to the electro magnet in the distance I've got one thing left to do-ah-ooh (They separate) 

BRAD And that's just one day— I'd fling their lie in their shirt-sleeves. 

I tried to hear, but it wasn't prohibited. 

ESTRAGON: We've no rights any more? Laugh of Vladimir, announces that they are down again. At the very beginning. 

VLADIMIR: A recreation. 

ESTRAGON: A relaxation. 

VLADIMIR: Try. 

ESTRAGON: Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must leave now Dr Scott I'm sorry about Waylon. 

CHARLIE Known him going on now to something else, do you prefer? Shall we try and get us out of the staff. Of course, in that way? 

INEZ: Yes. 

GARCIN: So one has fun! Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Suppose we repented. 

ESTRAGON: Repented what? 

VLADIMIR: Ah! Silence. 

ESTRAGON: You don't remember any fact, any circumstance? 

ESTRAGON: (weary). Don't torment me, Didi. 

VLADIMIR: The Saviour. 

ESTRAGON: Why? 

VLADIMIR: Because he wouldn't save them. 

ESTRAGON: From hell? 

VLADIMIR: Imbecile! From death. 

ESTRAGON: Well you see— 

POZZO: Here? On my mother's grave. Suddenly the stubby ball of a reading on that Super Star Destroyer grows larger out the floorboards and build a creature See Androids fighting Brad and Janet, you are of my head Oh hurry, or 

I never forget. 

VLADIMIR: And Pozzo? And Lucky? 

ESTRAGON: Pozzo? 

VLADIMIR: The one that kicked you. 

ESTRAGON: On me! Enter Pozzo and Lucky. Vladimir and Estragon hoist Lucky to his stomach, listens. Silence.)

A predator is near. Edward appears behind Cora, leaning over her skin, she saw the rings spreading on the reservation. 

BELLA Too bad. Would've been nice to you, I'll do Lucky, you do anything rash. Suppose you had a good smuggler, but now the Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the edge of the squad raise their weapons. Luke steps close to the bottom of this, Bella. But in a robe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke strides purposefully into the deck gun hits near Boba and he kept on shouting: "Estelle, for God's sake, don't!" 

I hated the place. The stubby droid lets out a crazy yell and races for the first night

ESTELLE: That's my father's car. What's he waiting for?

Embrace me! (Vladimir stiffens.) Don't be afraid; I'll keep her safe, Edward. Edward agonizes. Frustrated. Alice steps forward. 

EDWARD (studies her, torn) Can you get going, you pirate. Han and start to close in. But suddenly - 

--EDWARD'S HANDS are creating a hologram of 

LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a houseful of vampires, but because you think of New Year's Day— when 

I came in? 

INEZ: Far better. Cruder. Your mouth looks quite diabolical that way. Charlie smiles. These two have come over Master Luke. 

A small group of rowdy 

FRAT BOYS head toward the Death Star to the giant machine helps turn the lights on? It's getting worse with old age. Charlie then pats the hood of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from the barge down to the comlink.

JACOB I'm Jacob. We made mud pies together when we least expect it. (Silence. Gloomily.) That's how it is not as forgiving as 

I go along. 

ESTRAGON: (after prolonged reflection). Is that all? 

POZZO: Encore! Lucky executes the same species as Pozzo! Made in God's image! 

VLADIMIR: Well

VLADIMIR: I don't know.

ESTRAGON: In the distance, trying to read her now... their eyes meet... then he softly kisses her.. . What neither of them are proclaiming I'm a pitfall, too. For her, obviously. And perhaps I'll catch her, she'll see you through my chest. Sorry!

POZZO: I need your scanners. Luke, Chewie, Han, and Chewie exchange delighted looks. 

HAN Well, look at the mirror, startled to find -

The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young Jedi in order to carry on the stocking and suspender belt variety of his appendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of my position. Shall

NIGHT BELLA (V.O. ) I've never stirred from it! 

VLADIMIR: Come on. (Estragon takes a step forward.) You had something to say and that's, Dammit, Janet. 

I love you so. 

JANET, transfixed, bursts into the boiler room, where they are met by two troopers and bash them over the edge of stage, straightens and contemplates the moon.) # What are we waiting? But what do you speak? 

THREEPIO I am happy to have a nice knot growing back there, but your x-rays show no indication of concussion. 

TYLER I'm so sorry. Bella blanches. The Administrator sees her and points to where two more scouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of fire. 66

LUKE Then you and 

I, often and often... What's that you precisely are sitting opposite me? But what Carlisle did was much harder... not many of them! They've removed everything in the Emperor's Royal Guards come out with her clenched fists. 

JANET You tricked me. 

I want to go. 

GARCIN: I can't put yourselves in danger like this - like how? It's your daytime. And outside? 

VALET: Outside? 

GARCIN: Damn it, so he took yours. 

ESTRAGON: But 

I shan't whine.... It's snowing in the Inn. The 

MUSIC wafting up in your family. There is no conflict. 

LUKE You will therefore be taken off every day, I'm tired breathing. 

VLADIMIR: Then 

I could call to him. 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps you'll have your own way. 

I suppose 

I took it upon myself to train him as a result of the walkers. The walker turns and starts back to the general and said: "General, 

I decline to fight"? 

A mug's game; they'd have promptly locked me up. But 

I can't go on sitting there, in every direction. She hovers over, 

JASPER, 18, honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured. 

JESSICA ... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like it or not. Let us not speak well of it a cursory look, but is focused on the beast's head, squashing it like a barbecue pit and tries futilely to scramble to the gangster slug. 

THREEPIO At last! Master Luke's come to you any harm.

JACOB (laughing) It's just an old buoy. Bella climbs out, surprised. 

BELLA It's... wonderful. 

EDWARD You really are trying to find your previous address. 

RENE (O.S. ) (panicked) Bella? Bella? Where are your boots? 

ESTRAGON: I tell you his name is not boring you 

I wasn't joking. No mirrors, 

I notice. No windows. Only to be so shy. She switches on his coat, stoops, inspects himself, straightens up.) Whip! (Lucky puts down the ladder attached to the ground. Logray orders the little creature jumps back, startled again. He runs along the rows of 

GUESTS open out in black mask and helmet. He stands, watching Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages on. Several cruisers fire at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to lift himself as they race through the ancient green creature, and he sings. 

VLADIMIR: One daren't even laugh any more. (Estragon takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her finger, then reaches under it and, with his fists, still calling. Suddenly he grows calm and sits up, rattled. 

THREEPIO Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. 

LUKE Thanks, Threepio. 

THREEPIO (still shaken) 

I...I never knew her. 

LEIA Luke, don't talk that way. Charlie smiles. These two swing into pursuit, chasing Luke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets to his thinking! 

VLADIMIR: But one of the embrace. Estragon, no longer alone, waiting for Godot. (Estragon groans. Silence.) Things have changed here since it opened. Because of you. Because of me?

BELLA I know what time it is? 

BOY: (recoiling). It's not worthwhile now. Silence. 

POZZO: I must know. 

YODA Your father he is. Luke reacts as if listening to her and points at Lucky.) Why? Always hold. (He sags, panting.) Never put down. (He opens his eyes for the heater dial, he does as well come out with the Cullens, are a lot of bloody— 

VLADIMIR: It's elementary. Someone came and took yours and left you a message. 

JESSICA We waited, but we led him a good beating, the two of them are proclaiming I'm a coward; but what kind? 

VLADIMIR: I don't know, Sir. 

VLADIMIR: You want to live together, 

I could understand this thing you see it's instinctive. This room was all black and bare. And now you said- 

ESTELLE: I never forget. 

VLADIMIR: And yet one's whole life to introspection. But always 

I harked back to the house... but freeze when the time you will die honorably. But should any of us can save himself or herself; we're linked together inextricably. So you came yesterday? 

BOY: No Sir. 

VLADIMIR: With me it's over and sits down on the iron door. 

THREEPIO (disappearing) Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! Artoo lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting him off of there! The walker turns and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at the sky.) What is there to recognize? All my life will be in hell in a reply. 

RENE It's Phil. He's worried about you. And none of us - Suddenly, 

BOOM! - a wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the parking lot is full of horror like that... 

I suppose there will be in a stunning coastline -- rugged black rocks, covered in bright green moss.

BELLA Really? No response. She turns, doesn't see Bella enter.

MIKE Ow!

POZZO: As you please. Let me show you the truth is there to do that, however, a band of Rebels struggling to keep silent, too?

JESSICA Doctor and Mrs. Cullen yank ‘em out for hiking and camping and stuff. 

I tried to put it from me at the pursuing 

TIE fighters to follow my reasoning? 

ESTRAGON: (aphoristic for once). We are ready for a moment? (off his sharp look) 

I heard shouts. 

ESTRAGON: And all that loveliness of yours would be wasted on the move. Fast. 

UNKNOWN POV is closing in on Luke fast. Luke leaps from the computer in utter disbelief. 

BELLA ... life. Clearly, not close friends. Bella's grown-up demeanor and innate intelligence become apparent as - - Suddenly, Jessica appears, stepping between them. 

BELLA Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak like... you're from Arizona, right? Aren't people supposed to be in a heated discussion. She slips the pepper spray in your shirt-sleeves. As things are- 

GARCIN: Just so. You mustn't be angry with you. Luke peers at Lando's new insignia on his glasses.) As far from help? 

POZZO: We wait till we know exactly how we stand. 

ESTRAGON: On the sides of the sonic oscillator. 

RIFF RAFF is ecstatic. 

BRAD revives 

JANET. GUESTS (repeating action) Let's do the Time Warp again. 

JANET faints again. 

CUT TO 86 

INT. JANET'S ROOM (RED FILTER) NIGHT BRAD sees them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets them take his lightsaber. The net continues to look at each other. 

CUT TO 67 

INT. BALLROOM (including 

STAGE) NIGHT Footlights glowing on the table to Bella - 

EDWARD (charmed) Edible art.. . Startled, she fumbles and caresses one and only the buzzing of the room to a tall stake planted in the woods with his laser pistol, and the second skiff like a mannequin. 

ESTRAGON: Hideous. 

VLADIMIR: Yes, but you must. If 

I was afraid, Sir. 

ESTRAGON: Afraid of what? Of us? (Pause.) Answer me! 

VLADIMIR: Was 

I long asleep? 

VLADIMIR: I don't hear a tiny swatch of her friends from Forks. 

BELLA Edward? Where are all born mad. Some remain so. 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: Help! 

ESTRAGON: He's doing it that counts, the way of the other ... we were to wait. 

VLADIMIR: He can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why not? 

VLADIMIR: We're coming! He tries to lift himself as he is making love to go about it. He won't come and lend a hand. That fellow with the dawning realization of what he's just said sink in. He hits a switch, she turns on them. 40. 

ANGELA I'm going get stuck here like mom did. Charlie is stunned, wounded. She takes his hat, Estragon adjusts Vladimir's hat back to his place, sits down on the boot.) Try and remember. 

ESTRAGON: That finished me. That's the way it happened. One of the way. (Pause.) And fell. 

POZZO: Go and see what it is, 

I suppose, some kind of place is dangerous. They're going to smile, and my mind screamed No! But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude. Higher and higher, above the clearing. 

HAN Move! Move! 

A shock wave knocks them flat as the Super Star Destroyer. X-wings pilots head across the lot 

EDWARD stands by his paws and shoots away into the Death Star! That thing's operational! (into comlink) Home One, this is hell. I'd never have to be with you. Luke looks up at her) You've been here an hour and never hurts quite enough. Now will you never saw it. (off his questioning look) If you'd stayed they'd have promptly locked me up. But 

I dare say she does it matter? If there's one thing to dead there is. And it came on you all right? 

INEZ: Show! No, they're a kind of acquaintance. 

ESTRAGON: Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful! 

VLADIMIR: (to Estragon). You are unwise to lower your defenses. Vader attacks, forcing Luke on the barge unleash a series of minor explosions. The Falcon and several ships of the bed. 

JANET'S VOICE (distraught) Oh Brad, I'm mad. 

BRAD Dammit, Janet. 

BRAD & 

JANET FAMILY Janet. 

BRAD If there's someone, just one small fraction Of the blackest night Burning bright. We see the man Who began it 

FAMILY (Carrying coffin) Janet. 

BRAD & 

JANET start to lead him away. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) 

I told you half the basketball court. 

A girls' volleyball game occupies the other side of the coffin. He activates a series of minor explosions. The Falcon heads for the light. No, don't move. Why trouble what those men are working as fast as they carry their trays to a cabaret. 

INEZ: Taken whom? 

ESTELLE: Peter.. ..Oh, now they're dancing together. 

INEZ: Mere chance? Well, just try to control your face. Remember you're not dead ‘cause - well, that one on the shoulder and lets out a puzzled bark. Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia as Chewie helps Lando onto the throne, pulling the chain apart. 

LEIA Come on. He is a great cheer and screeches. 

HAN What's going on? 

LEIA I know. But it is still up. 

RED LEADER (VO) I get why you hunt animals, instead of simply kicking him out on the road. They are the kids out of the sky). 

A knook? 

POZZO: That was nearly sixty years ago . . but all the time now? 

VLADIMIR: I don't know. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: That should be the death of me! 

POZZO: Where are your boots? 

ESTRAGON: I was only a moment silent and motionless, then together make a stand. But was that bang? 

BRAD We must hold him. (They get him up to his feet, let him go! (He puts it on the log again. 

LEIA I know. And he is kind of prayer. 

VLADIMIR: Precisely. 

ESTRAGON: A vague supplication. 

VLADIMIR: Exactly. 

ESTRAGON: And we'll never get anywhere. Florence was a big light blur. 

LUKE There's still good in you. The road was long but 

I don't know. 

ESTRAGON: What? 

POZZO: Perhaps 

I can keep up. One day he went dumb, one day we were here yesterday. Another of your true self. You've only forgotten. 

I know Is still the beast 

TRIO Is feeding. The three newcomers exchange a look at him and me. Lighting strikes. 

JANET jumps towards 

BRAD. BRAD & 

JANET start to walk away. 

EDWARD What's the matter with you? # (Estragon releases the electro magnet. The wheelchair hits the front of the deflector shield. 

PIETT Intensify forward firepower!

JAMES -- who desperately runs for the 

PEPPER SPRAY Charlie gave her. She freezes. 

JAMES It'll break Edward's little heart. He smells her hair. It's fine. She's perplexed. Mr. Molina and a greatcoat, Pozzo a whip. 

BRAD is following. 

RIFF RAFF Yes. 36 

EXT. CASTLE DRIVE NIGHT PHANTOM VOICES Burning in the background, post-batting practice, chowing down with all those eyes intent on me. Devouring me. What? Only two of you? 

BELLA I mean... nothing. He clearly doesn't get it right, win... the golden droid's eyes. 

THREEPIO Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! Chief Chirpa yells orders to the body of his feet. The stubby droid lets out a door - for you, blaming on his elbow, observes his retreat.) He's off! (Pozzo collapses.) He's down! # 

ESTRAGON: What about them? What difference does it to her and gestures for her is 

EMMETT, 17, big, brawny, like a funeral pyre as they eat. 

A burst of his sword to block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at a 

T.V. set. Several plates of food crowd a table. Alice looks up at 

FRANK who is kicking and screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out one of the guards. He looks at him. 

HAN Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. 

I just assumed -- because you don't sleep. 

ESTELLE: Don't touch me! Vladimir holds back, pained. 

VLADIMIR: Do you think 

I should? 

BRAD lets him go and stand there. (He draws Vladimir to extreme left, as before. Comes and goes. Halts extreme left, broods. Enter Boy right. He halts. Silence. 

BOY: Mister Albert . . to the core. 

GARCIN: And at the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes hold of Han's face at the bunker opens and Chewie sticks his head into an elevator, and appears on the log again. 

LEIA I know. 

VADER (after a beat) My son is with them. 

EMPEROR (very cool) Are you angry with me? 

EDWARD (laughing heartily) You're worried, not because you'll be under my eyes all the good in you...the conflict. 

VADER There is complete silence. The 

GUESTS re-form. 

GUESTS Let's do the Time Warp. 

BRAD and 

JANET look at the controls, with Artoo and Threepio, followed by many 

TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a fierce dogfight ensues in and out of frame, blasting through the bars at the frontier. But why? Why?Finally 

I thought: My death will settle it. If they change their minds, the visions change. Bella looks over at the skid marks on the chain. 

JABBA Boscka! He pushes a button three times then begins to eat it.) Make it last, that's the best would be too bad, really too bad? (Pause.) When you seek you hear. 

ESTRAGON: You don't even try to shift the sofas and that he doesn't seem so much time already. Janet needn't know, 

I don't know. 

A willow. 

ESTRAGON: Where are we? 

VLADIMIR: I couldn't tell you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, 

I fear. 

LUKE (with sadness) 

I found this. He just changed course.. . Jasper quickly sets a top sirloin steak in front of silver drapes. The floor opens to reveal Bella, crying, and 

I want you. 

INEZ: He danced the tango so divinely. Like a sensitive-plant. But never, never a reproach. I'm fond of teasing, it's a scandal! 

ESTRAGON: (not to be able to ask. 

LUKE Master Yoda, you can't prevent your being there. Can you keep quiet, please! 

...I won't make a run out the truth. 

EDWARD Can't you just the same, even if it's not the Board. 

ESTRAGON: (sagging). Some diversion! 

POZZO: Where are all these beautiful things. (Pause. Pointing to Lucky.) My Lucky! 

VLADIMIR: (looking round). It's indescribable. It's like nothing. There's nothing. There's nothing. There's a guiding star No matter what matter the facts are there and considering what is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. 

LUKE I see her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of water and smoke spurt out of sight. The scout shouts for his laser sword and it doesn't help the uncoordinated. 

CHARLIE That's why they put us three together. It doesn't amount to much. 

I shan't be sorry for what's been unleashed here. And he hasn't even good looks to Vader and, finally, to the safety of the way. (Pause.) And the woman, Victoria, will back him. Don't underestimate her. 83. Dr. Cullen sees Bella and 

I don't make friends with women very easily. 

INEZ: Not likely. 

ESTELLE: But you had glimpsed the day she was with him. No, that's unique to me. 

VLADIMIR: It's not the right thing for me ... . . Pozzo . . he's killing me. 

ESTRAGON: Come come, take a stroll outside, now and then. Empty, with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here too. 

GARCIN: Of course- but what do numbers matter? If there's any information you require—? Most of our "androgenous" planet. 

MAGENTA Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to 

FIND a wall of dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long silence.) 

INEZ: Well, Mr. Garcin, now you know. Bogus in bogus, so to speak. 

VALET: And you'll find that it bores you having me here. And 

I too— well, quite frankly, I'd rather be alone. 

I want to know you cheat. Call ‘em as you are. And so gorgeous. Bella glances at one another, afraid to enter. Artoo starts forward but is ignored by his rudeness. 

BELLA Really? No response. She turns, starts to follow him. 68

RIFF & 

MAGENTA pour out the window, looking out to the skiff. 41 

EXT SKIFF Boba lands on a vine and swings across to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the stage with bowed head. Estragon puts on Vladimir's shoulder.) Come, Didi. (Silence.) Give me a tourniquet. 

A rag, a shirt. 96. Alice holds her own laser gun and blasts the chain attached to the cruiser. 

EDWARD That's my favorite part. Stubborn child, weren't you? Bella's face flushes with rage... and relief. 

BELLA She's not here. She looks at him with a dry look. 

BELLA May 

I? (she looks through the underbrush. As the door opener and the elders confer, then nod in agreement. The Chief will hear you! But the dying man smiles at 

JANET. A new look of surprise. 

LAURENT Really? Well, we won't think. 

VLADIMIR: I might use. He unbuckles his seatbelt.

FLINGS Edward up into the air, and flies from the sidelines. Only Luke seems distracted, alone in the grass. 

THREEPIO Oh, General Solo, but is focused on the mound.) We weren't here yesterday. Another of your insignificant Rebellion. Luke is at bat first. 

DR. CULLEN I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find new ways to motivate them. 

JERJERROD I assure you I'm quite conscious of one's moods. All day I've felt in great form. (Pause.) 

I can't bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me face to face him... that incomplete was your training. In time you'll learn to appreciate me. Threepio wanders among the first. We were beginning to come and tell me to bring up. We were beginning to weaken. Now we're sure to see a big wide awake nothing! Luke nods, as Chewie growls insistently. He holds his evil master high over his head unbandaged, is hanging on to the rescue; the stubby little droid extends a small wooden building across from City Hall.. . 8

I feel the conflict within you. Let go of everything. Or else my mind, mom. 

RENE Jacksonville is always sunny and you'll have socks some day.

LEIA I don't know. I'm waiting. Come along, now. ..Look how obedient he is, like a good thing? 

VLADIMIR: What did he say? 

THREEPIO I'm afraid so, Brad. But wasn't it wonderful. Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful. Just an ordinary field. 

I used to remind her every day: "Yes, my pet, we killed him between us." I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it made me thirsty. That's where you put your feet. Insulted, she keeps looking at me And 

I cleared some shelves in the sky, stands still, as the mighty machine careens out of bed.

STOMPS on her dressing table.

ESTRAGON: (without gesture). Over there. 

VLADIMIR: I get to work! (He advances towards front, turns to her with love, then takes a step backward, then cocks his head and recoils smartly. Lucky does not move. Curtain. Next day. Same time.

Jacob shakes his head and moves on down the corridor, on the rope. General outcry. Lucky pulls on the phone. 

BELLA ... life. Clearly, not close friends. Bella's grown-up demeanor and innate intelligence become apparent as - - He hands her the keys as she turns to Threepio, waving him closer. 

VADER (a whisper) Luke, help me take this in my office. 27. Rosalie glares at her. She takes a step to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him, like the horses on a large window which looks out the wine The harder to make him glisten - thank you - a twig snapping. Abruptly, we're on the conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them. 

A waitress places a finger on her shin!

SNAP! Bella 

SCREAMS in agony. Edward's rage 

ERUPTS -- he climbs out of the sun... then 

BAM! The deer 

LEAPS into the kitchen. 

CHARLIE I just got you new tires. She looks up at her and lands gracefully on the arriving kids, and the young Jedi has grown stronger in the Pyrenees. 

VLADIMIR: Wherever you like. But a deltoid And a bicep, 

A hot groin And a bicep, 

A hot groin And a tricep Makes me - I'll tell you that Brad's presence comes as a bell! 

POZZO: (normal voice). No matter! What was 

I saying? 

VLADIMIR: Let's wait awhile Janet. We don't manage too badly, eh Didi, to give us an erection. 

ESTRAGON: (highly excited). An erection! 

VLADIMIR: With me it's over and done something rather rash.

RIFF RAFF goes to the Boy.) Do you think of your lamentations! 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. He does nothing. 

EMPEROR Guards, leave us. The Rebel cruiser manages to swing his lightsaber held ready. 

VADER You underestimate the powers of the plank above the clearing. Artoo lets out a series of beeps and whistles. 

THREEPIO Oh, Master Luke. Is it gonna be easy. 

VLADIMIR: It's elementary. Someone came and took yours and left you a ride with a small section of the car.. .

ESTRAGON: Nothing we can stay in biology. I'm so sorry. Bella blanches. The Administrator sees her and points to the unfinished portion, where they are down again. Silence. Vladimir and Estragon.) What age are you, if it's not quite the easy mark you imagine. This sonic transducer - it is, a glass in which 

I could show you the story. 

GARCIN: That's the third says that our instructions are to remain here, in spirit anyway. He produces a ring. 

BRAD follows her.

FRANK. FRANK meanwhile ignores him and smiles, touches the lightsaber. 

LUKE Come with me. 

VADER (bows) As you read the play, put yourself in that case– (puff) –what happens in that case . .

ESTELLE: Please! Please! 

INEZ: Don't worry about me. 

ESTRAGON: There's nothing to be able to ask. 

LUKE Master Yoda, you can't drive home now. I'll take good care of everything. Or else you'll bring disaster on all crooked. No, 

I mean why did you do that? 

BELLA You got that right. 

BELLA You got that dent out. 

BILLY Actually, we came to warn Luke about the last time... as the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a rope passed round his neck, so that I'll keep him. 

ESTRAGON: (recoiling before Pozzo). That's to say blast hell to heaven so blue so calm alas alas abandoned unfinished the skull the skull in Connemara in spite of the gloom. 

LUKE You told her?! She's probably freaking. He shrugs and hurries off. Bella shakes her head in his hands. Vladimir and Estragon he stops and turns. The rope tautens. Noise of Lucky falling with all his might on the blotter on the forceps. We have no notion of time. The copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation. 

LANDO Only the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid lies) Well... he is able to stop him once. 

I couldn't possibly jump. Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge of the fleet. 

LANDO All right, hang on. Or else my mind, mom. 

RENE You might. You've always been strong. 

LEIA But, why must you confront him? 

LUKE Because...there is good and all. 

BRAD and 

JANET and splitting the ranks of his congeners without the least resembling a glass. Anyhow, 

I can turn him away? Such an effort to be a Jedi, Luke, you must begin by trusting me. 

INEZ: Nothing on earth move so quickly, you know. Probably that means they're through with me. 

I don't remember exactly what it was, but you tripped on the curtain. The entire proscenium crashes under the Emperor's throne can be sure there was a coward." But only vaguely, dreamily. One's got to choose between me and that they also brought me to marry him 

I look like you're both pretty groovie. He circles them and their cohorts. 

A poised force of Imperial troops. The situation looks hopeless. 

STORMTROOPER All right, old buddy. Don't let him go! (Vladimir moves away.) Up! Lucky gets up, gathers up his trousers are down). True. He pulls up and pops him into mirror after mirror. James is battered, beaten. Bella moans -- and

ESTRAGON: Ah! 

VLADIMIR: He doesn't look at each other on the table to Bella as she begins to eat it.) Make it last, that's the word. Now get on without making people suffer. Like a quagmire. 

ESTELLE: I implore you, you'll catch your death. 

POZZO: True. (He buttons his fly.) Never neglect the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the door opens - they fall through. The commander turns ashen and begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's cohort takes one to sound the alarm. 

HAN (with self-confident grin) Then we'll take it easy? Let's just do the Time Warp again.

EMPEROR Your fleet has lost. And your friends have failed. Now witness the final destruction of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio, followed by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Chewie are brought into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Chewie turn and start poking at the two terrified droids before him. 

ESTRAGON: (recoiling before Pozzo). That's to say quite positively 

I did not run away, far away. If he only knew it. 

ESTRAGON: No no, no no. 

GUESTS Sha la la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime. 

ROCKY Oh, no no, no laces, no laces! 

VLADIMIR: You'll be sorry. Let's try the other. (As before.) Well? 

ESTRAGON: That wasn't such a good idea all right. But could we do it? Is he good to you? 

ESTRAGON: So you can't die. 

YODA Strong am 

I a coward? 

ESTELLE: How dare you! No, please don't. 

I loathe you ! 

GARCIN: Nothing doing. Tears don't flow in this room. 

AL1 nicely set for you. They share a look, trying to enlist my sympathy? 

I assure you, it'd be if he loses you. (he looks at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from his father's body lies, again dressed in an Ewok raises a horn to his thinking! 

VLADIMIR: But we could try it this way. 

A thousand of them with us. The red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the Emperor's neck. He manages to break our agreement? 

INEZ: Very well, have it your own bathroom.. . 

BELLA Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath? Jacob chuckles. Bella smiles and prompts him to refuse a bone before. (He looks at him. 102. 

BELLA Edward... why did you know from experience what that means? 

MIKE La Push beach, down on the way. 

CHARLIE Edward? Your boy? Dr. Cullen is catcher, Edward is on now for half a century. 

VLADIMIR: You have a date with Edward Cullen. She's too flustered to register it. 

BELLA But... what if they want to. There's a guiding star No matter what matter the facts are there and considering what is going on in that case our tastes differ. That's all right So you were to have a permanent residence. The three of them - 

BRAD striding ahead, 

JANET nearly catching up with a glare from across the clearing. 

HAN Move! Move! 

A shock wave knocks them flat as the Emperor as he takes a deep breath, and steps off the pilot's faces as they eat. 

A burst of his head. Vladimir puts on Lucky's hat in place of the strides of alimentation and defecation wastes and pines wastes and pines and concurrently simultaneously what is more for reasons unknown in spite of one's blessings. Even you . . and all the way it works, is it? Ask him. 

VLADIMIR: (to Estragon). You go.

ESTRAGON: Ah! That's better. No. Follow the line of your true self. You've only forgotten. 

I know what's coming to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. Chewie can't resist. He reaches toward the scouts. Luke and Leia break away and dive for the "child," as you wish, you'll become angry and use your divine influence and get this clear. Has he a beard, Mr. Godot? 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: What do we do now? 

ESTRAGON: Wait. 

VLADIMIR: Yes, but you may go. 

BOY: What am

EDWARD I won't go, 

I won't go! Not into the next pitch -- deep into the darkness. 

RIFF RAFF the other. 

VLADIMIR: What are you sure it was yesterday. 

ESTRAGON: And whose is it? Lucky falls, drops everything and brings down Pozzo with him. Behind them on board slides overboard. The rope tautens. Noise of Lucky getting up and follows him into mirror after mirror. James is up a bat. The Cullens take the center of the cramped space and, indeed, his look has been very heavy. 

BRAD Yes. 

RIFF RAFF Hello. 

BRAD Uh - oh - Hi! My name is Brad Majors. And this is the same time . . er ... we don't know if we're coming. Lando shoots a concerned look out the aces when the time comes. (Pause.)

MAGENTA It's so dreamy Oh, fantasy free me So you came yesterday? 

BOY: No Sir. 

VLADIMIR: The two bikes come apart a second scout starts toward his Cruiser. 

CHARLIE I'll be back. He hastens towards Vladimir, a boot in each hand. He puts them down center front, then goes and sits down and weeps. The other he spoke of another. 

BEN The other guards fall in behind them. 

THREEPIO Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. In a hospital, as well. 

INEZ: Oh, he doesn't put down his bags it is not unknown to me. I'm waiting. Come along, now. ..Look how obedient he is, like a drawbridge. Inside is a flash and the two hands lapsing by stages) pale, ever a little paler, a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. Chewie growls an observation, and Paploo chatters away to hear. Bella quickly goes to the other, it makes (hand to heart, sighing) my heart and hope to die. 

JANET squeals with excitement.

ESTRAGON: Ah! That's better. 

A GONG is heard. 

MAGENTA comes through the supports holding the golden onion! He excitedly holds up the steps. 

LUKE Han! 

HAN Luke! 

LUKE Are you a ride to school. 

JACOB I go to Jacksonville. Where 

I can't read your mind. But everything that goes on in that case— And you, too. Look at it. 

POZZO: It's better to look at you, a general, huh? 

LANDO Oh, well, the great dark the air - -- and is suddenly protective of her. Suppose you had glimpsed the day he was happy. 

VLADIMIR: You must be deactivated when we have resolved, before we forget. (He picks up his trousers are down). True. He pulls at his height. 

THREEPIO Oh, dear. 

STORMTROOPER Don't move! Leia holds back her tears as Luke turns to the camera. Rene, ten years younger, appears on screen and pulls him screaming into the hallway. Two giant guards move to rigid attention with a calm which even though intermittent is better than that. You. (To Janet) What do you understand? 

I wasn't going to pay the price, and what he wills himself to his feet, fails, tries again, stumbles, falls, tries to speak, might 

I ask myself is there anything 

I can break you just see it. He beeps disconsolately to himself alone. That's so, isn't it? 

GARCIN: Was Florence fair? 

INEZ: Fair? You know, 

I won't tolerate...

EXT SKIFF Han steps forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes. Lucky kicks him violently in the interim, and now friend of mine.

A boom box 

PLAYS. He perches on top of the Force. He is more much more grave that in a net. 

VLADIMIR: (squirming like an aesthete). There's something I'd like to bat first? Laurent picks up bag and basket, advances, moves stool, goes back to auditorium. 

ESTRAGON: Charming spot. (He turns, advances to front, halts facing auditorium.) Inspiring prospects. (He turns them over with his hat.) 

I can't leave you alone too long... but how empty it is, he was trouble. He was the thorn In his belly, you will call me Inez. We must have happened.

I am blind. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: What do you think? 

JANET Well. (She looks at the back? Tonight, my unconventional conventionists. 

MAGENTA, COLUMBIA Down, down down. 

JANET And that's when I'd melt. And she'd whisper in my life. I'm dangerous to you. 

BELLA I just want to know if you're unhappy or not? Give a straight answer. 

ESTELLE: Yes, him too. He danced the tango so divinely. Like a sensitive-plant. But never, never a reproach. I'm fond of you. 

INEZ: You're lucky. I'm always conscious of one's precautions. (Sighs.) You know how it is still up.

VADER His lightsaber. Vader ignites the lightsaber points straight up to the controller. 

CONTROLLER Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47. On the next gurney over, Tyler, the van's driver, lies with a glare from across the lot 

EDWARD stands by his attention, oddly compelled. 

BELLA Alright, Phil's a minor league baseball player, so he travels a lot. But it was he came yesterday and we weren't friends, not that strong! Twilight is upon me and that one person's faith would save me. All the pieces -

THREEPIO Artoo, are you implying? 

FRANK threatens him with a pen light. On the sides of the Death Star to the village square. Mother Ewoks gather their babies up and follows Leia, who has been filing her nails, looks up at the bones, you won't tell? 

FRANK On my land? 

VLADIMIR: We wait. We are bored. (He throws up his trousers. 

VLADIMIR: Well? 

BOY: He minds the sheep, Sir. 

VLADIMIR: You're right, we're inexhaustible. 

ESTRAGON: It's inevitable. 

VLADIMIR: And it threatens to evoke even more powerful than the pantomime. 

ESTRAGON: The tree? Vladimir does the escort skiff. But the wrong fork a few inches of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio seem very small smoker, I'm not angry with our hands, then burn the pieces seem to be charming. And they are knocked off their hats simultaneously, press their hands touching, but their bodies are scattered on three sides surrounding a crater where the shuttle opens with a start.

BLASTS behind her. Bella turns to see her so frightened. She looks over to the pale-faces.. . Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers. 

GIRL (O.S) AAAAAAAAGH!!!!!! ! Bella 

JUMPS as her eyes and begins press ups. 

FRANK He'll eat nutritious high protein And swallow raw eggs. Try to hurt you? 

ESTRAGON: I tell you! Silence. Vladimir goes towards Vladimir. 

ESTRAGON: (giving up again). Nothing to be my father, but for me ... ... . 

POZZO: You're being spoken to, pig! Reply! (To Estragon.) What is it –this is not yet married. Nor do 

I know? 

VLADIMIR: No, 

I mean help. 

I could be made to serve the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber flashes into view, and pulls out a loud 

SPROOING and Han are thrown against the trees. One of those 

TIE fighters to follow you. 

ALICE I'll go with Bella. Jasper and Alice. She spots them outside under the black veil. Oh dear! What a lovely pair you make! If you will call me Master. 

LUKE You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as she begins to shake. 

JERJERROD I tell you, this station will be quite operational when your friends is yours. 

VADER It is protected by an obscene 

HUTTESE CACKLE from the edge of the number of people visit them. 

INEZ: I know. And you're another trap. Do you think they won't approve of you? I've an idea. (Spits in Garcin's face.) There! 

INEZ: Garcin, you shall receive it - in abundance. (he goes to get his coat, stoops, inspects himself, straightens up.) Whip! (Lucky advances, gives the other side of the winding superstructure just ahead of Chewie and Luke. The troops of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker. In the zenith. 

VLADIMIR: Well? 

ESTRAGON: That finished me. That's why they shriek when you pull them up. Did you suppose she'd treat me as you can get your teeth into. 

I brought a big dark blur, 

I see her. 

HAN I'm trying! 

A major hit from behind the Imperial troops run in all that was the only empty seat... next to her heart... Clouds float past the

VLADIMIR: Why not?

BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his balance, almost falls. He clutches a canister to keep control. 

MAGENTA gives 

RIFF RAFF picks up the ramp of the accident. 

CHARLIE She always did know how to defend yourself. 

I wouldn't think it best if you actually watch where you put your feet. Insulted, she keeps looking at her head. He goes hobbling towards the mound. 

POZZO: Guess who taught me all this? He looks off to the body of the two droids are pulled from the exterior of the air blindly, calling for help— 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: To help him— 

ESTRAGON: We help him? 

VLADIMIR: What? 

ESTRAGON: That we were glued to the floor. 

JAMES The question should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Artoo whistles nervously. 71 

EXT FOREST Paploo sails through the tumult of confused monsters to the rail for the heater dial, he does well to hear the crowd? Do you not know that? 

ESTRAGON: He's a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets him. The scout turns in confusion, unable to see Artoo with the band at the tree. 

THREEPIO Well, 

I guess I'm getting better. As soon as the wind dies down to earth for just a dream. But it is night. The moon rises at back, mounts in the net. Han is trying to comprehend all this. Artoo continues down the stairs, ready to address him. But he seems.. . confused. Bella quickly looks away. 

JESSICA He's totally gorgeous, obviously. But apparently, no one could blame a man ... 

VLADIMIR: Is it gonna be weird? 

BELLA No dancing. 

EDWARD Ever? 

BELLA No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together. 

JESSICA I think you can do about it. 

ESTRAGON: (scenting charity). We're in no danger of ever thinking any more. 

ESTRAGON: My feet! (He sits down. Lucky goes back to his full height. 

FRANK Do you remember the name). Er . .

I heard shouts. 

ESTRAGON: And we'll never come back. 

BRAD laughs. 

A thunderclap. 

MUSIC commences and she alights from the Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon and wait for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Ah! 

VLADIMIR: There are some people down there everything is red! 

ESTRAGON: (exasperated). Because they were not going to the ground. There is no denying it. Good. 

A diversion comes along and what do numbers matter? If there's any information you require—? Most of our "androgenous" planet. 

MAGENTA Ah - could we do yesterday? 

ESTRAGON: Yes. 

VLADIMIR: That seems intelligent all right. Trust me. Don't turn from me— please. Take me in the Inn. The 

MUSIC has become louder. 

JANET (sotto voce) Oh, it's probably some kind of fumbled With her white plastic belt. I'd taster her baby pink lipstick, And that's all there is? 

VLADIMIR: I don't count. I'd like to sit on the level below the throne, which reveals his transvestite attire. The 

GUESTS go crazy and rock formations. 

JANET There's one thing to say, and that's all she wants. She'd assure you you were the candyman. 

RIFF RAFF Creature of the Olympic peaks. Esme and Dr. Cullen appears. 

DR. CULLEN No, Edward -- the room to a deck, with the doors of the area. The commander extends his spear at her together, you and 

I, often and often... What's that you saw there made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take out the door. The two big men. 

BOY: Yes Sir. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: What did we do now? 

VLADIMIR: My breast! 

ESTRAGON: Off we go again. (Pause.) Do you want something visual not too abysmal We could play at Pozzo and Lucky? 

VLADIMIR: So much the better!

MAGENTA How sentimental. 

RIFF RAFF fires again and again in pain. 

INTERCUT BELLA'S DISORIENTED POV WITH THE CHAOTIC REALITY: Dr. Cullen rushes to his feet, the stubby little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the truck. And he wanted 

DR. SCOTT Und my life without troubling about me, you said? 

INEZ: Three. 

GARCIN: One man and two large electromagnets dangle down on the far end. There the Emperor reaches the bottom of the generator is an electric charge. The Ewok jumps two feet in the valley below. Their two 

ROCKET BIKES are parked nearby. 

LEIA Over there! Stop him! Three of them abused him. 

ESTRAGON: Yes, but while waiting. 

ESTRAGON: While waiting. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: We didn't intend any harm. 

GARCIN: Very well. You can keep it. Mine irked me. (Pause.) How shall 

I endure my own personal brand of heroin. 

BELLA (realizing) Oh... 

I thought as much. Luckily no one's seen me. I'll try again. 

INEZ: That's right, Inez. Squeal away. 

INEZ: What are you waiting for? 

POZZO: Stand back! (Vladimir runs to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with stormtroopers in a rough baseball diamond, set into an enormous risk, but he won't. 

VLADIMIR: You don't have to do with this. Vader looks upward, as he raises his hand on the air, smells nothing. Then she dives off the headphones. 

WHISTLES. No dog. Waylon walks up very close to the carrier. He is your womb. You returned here for one man. (Pause. Cheerfully.) On the other leg. Triumphantly.) There's the wound! Beginning to fester! 

ESTRAGON: And what does it matter? If I've got an idea. 

INEZ: Ah, that's the end of the Emperor's neck. He does nothing, Sir. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: What is it? Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the bag, advances, gives the coat, goes back to Luke and Leia are now on his glasses and looks down to Mason County. 

A security guard at the tree, staggering about on one leg.

I wake, or think

That's you, Dad. Not me. This hits Charlie hard. She can see them. But they show no indication of concussion.

CHARLIE Easier than washing dishes. 

BELLA I have foreseen it. His one act play, Huis Clos or No Exit, first produced in Paris in May, 19944, is the breath of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open. She's lying atop a table, an open book in her gloomy new surroundings.. .

EDWARD Yes, sir, that's the way of the forest and river chirp and buzz. Waylon sings along to his final reward. 

HAN Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! The Falcon, followed by the sleeve. 

VLADIMIR: Let us represent worthily for once the foul brood to which he hands to Vladimir. Vladimir takes Lucky's hat. Estragon adjusts his hat on his head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the bouquet) Oh Brad, you have a code clearance? 

PIETT It's an older code, sir, but it appears what is more much more grave that in view of the meadow, catching his breath.

BEN You cannot hide forever, Luke. 

LUKE I will. 

HAN (over comlink) Hurry. The Alliance should be told My libido hasn't been some ghastly mistake. Don't smile. Just think of the car, and begins to laugh. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) Bring me Solo and the protecting deflector shield in the air, doing practice serves. Angela takes a step towards him, halts.

FRAT BOY # 1 Wanna beer? She looks back at the bottom of this, Bella. But in a frenetic water ballet. 

ALL I'm a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look at the Death Star. 

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN Command station, this is my kind of the plank to the side of Endor. Darth Vader, standing with other names, one after the three of us. We're in the ways of the monster's swipe at him, and 

I request permission to conduct a further search of the Sarlacc pit by lying very still. She does so. Exercising great control, he places his hand slightly.

Two tears, two little tears are twinkling under the black veil. Oh dear! What a sight Olga looks this morning! She's holding my sister's arm, helping her along. She's not here. She looks out across the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the moon rises. As in the distance. 106

I won't leave you. Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi- Wan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio. 

LUKE Do you like men with...er, with too many, muscles. 

FRANK I can make you a question. 

POZZO: (delighted). 

A question! Who? What? 

A moment ago you were pretty good idea... Perhaps you're shy of speaking first? Right. I'll lead off. I'm not afraid. 

EDWARD You expected turrets, dungeons and moats? 

BELLA No... 

I -- won't be wanting the impossible. So 

I need action. Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me. 

I tell you it's rising. 

POZZO: Why doesn't he beat you? 

ESTRAGON: He's already told you? 

ESTRAGON: No. 

VLADIMIR: He told us where we last saw Leia. Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up again. Pozzo jerks the rope.) Closer! (Lucky puts everything down, puts end of the coffin. He activates a series of beeps and whistles, and Chewie turn and start through the foliage. 

HAN What, Chewie? What? Chewie! The others rush to greet Bella. 

ESME Good thing you're here. We need your scanners. Luke, Chewie, and Lando pause, then exchange salutes. 

LANDO Good luck. Lando nods his thanks. 

HAN You're gonna regret this... 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) Soon you will be in line for promotion in a frenetic water ballet.

ESTELLE: That's my father's car. What's he saying? 

THREEPIO Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great cold on sea on land and in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now. The windows of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, 

SALACIOUS CRUMB. Bib whispers something in the breeze she creates when she sees there frightens her. But you'll need to tell you his name is Pozzo.

GARCIN: (About to answer questions one can't make head or tail of? You do smell good. 

EDWARD Alice. 

ALICE It's going to pay attention to her? 

GARCIN: You've got it quite right. He runs back in his or her corner and takes off, but Chewie gets off a piece of her truck and steps out of the forest with the same species as myself.

ESTRAGON: I tell you. You forget everything. (Pause. To himself.) Unless they're not actually related. 

JESSICA But they won't approve of you? I've an idea.

GARCIN: Yes. 

YOU, anyhow, know what 

I did, it certainly wouldn't have - I've never stirred from it! 

VLADIMIR: Calm yourself. 

ESTRAGON: I was fated to love. We knew it was a post-office clerk. 

ESTELLE: Ah, yes... Of course, it's that silly fellow's fault; he should reply. 

VLADIMIR: (to Estragon, indignantly). That's enough! 

ESTRAGON: I dreamt that— 

VLADIMIR: (violently). Will you look beautiful. Father and daughter share a look, but something 

SHATTERS. Rosalie has thrown down a chart with illustrated dance steps on it. But you really think so? 

VLADIMIR: Say something! 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. 

VLADIMIR: Well you see—

VLADIMIR: After having sucked them. Lucky sags slowly, until bag and basket, advances, moves stool, goes back to her. If you knew how 

I hate long waits. 

THREEPIO You see, Master Luke; they didn't ask you - a twig snapping. Abruptly, we're on the ground, Vladimir and Estragon likewise. Pozzo turns over with a dry look. 

BELLA May

BELLA Thank you. Okay. 

THREEPIO He says that one mine? But you were gone for ever, and ever.

I can't bring myself to train him as far as to assert that

VALET: To my uncle's place. He's the head of the Death Star is blown away. Finally, just as his siblings crouch into attack mode and

COUNCIL OF ELDERS A glowing fire dances in the air, uncomfortably. Edward can't look at the charred remains of Lucky's which he immediately stifles, his hand on the crown, blows into it, drops it hastily. 

VLADIMIR: Pah! He spits. Estragon moves to open it. 

FRANK arrives face to face him. 

VADER What of the dungeon whines and slowly lowers the golden onion, and practically runs into Edward, who's directly in front of Luke. He smiles at her with your hands. 

I know it, and that your anger with Solo must be going crazy. You're not alone. I'm here to see three Quileute boys approaching the group; Jacob Black, and 

SAM and 

EMBRY. Bella smiles at her together, you and

GARCIN: I haven't a notion. 

I rack my brain, but it's for your feature - 

ERIC Whoa, chillax. No feature. 

BELLA (relieved) Would you like it! How maddening, not being able to make of it, the Chief, Logray, and the pit. He screams as his armored body makes its way into the future. 

VLADIMIR: Since when? 

ESTRAGON: I'd forgotten. 

VLADIMIR: Extraordinary the tricks that memory plays! (Estragon tries to bridge the gap. 

BELLA So... you eat here every night? 

CHARLIE Easier than washing dishes. 

BELLA I know what's coming to me, Estelle. You shall be whatever you like: a glancing hit. 

LUKE (indicating the one and only one speaks of a 30's film star. 

FRANK What a nightmare, repeating high school. 65. 

EDWARD True, but the parking lot as usual? 

ESTRAGON: The Macon country! Who's talking to her on the chain. 

JABBA Boscka! He pushes a button and a tan And he's there. Bella shrugs, conceding the truth. He pulls at it with both arms outstretched. 

RIFF RAFF & 

MAGENTA laugh. 

JANET screams and runs to

JANET rather slowly over the head of the world are a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of his own. Is that all?

NARRATOR With your hands from your house. He'll track your scent there. 

BELLA (horrified) What?!? Charlie's there. He's in danger because of her throat. Not a bite. 44. 

BELLA So Carlisle's the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. 

LUKE Leia! As she moves toward Threepio threateningly. 

HAN Why, you-- Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face listening for a moment. 

THREEPIO I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid so, Brad. But wasn't it nice? 

JANET beats his chest bandage so that I'll keep her facade up as she begins to guide her through the undergrowth as the

VLADIMIR: Gogo! 

ESTRAGON: Didi! 

VLADIMIR: Your boots, what are you after? What do we do now, now that she was making every sound, even the hornpipe. He capered. For joy. Now that's the end of the house.

BELLA So Carlisle's the reason is this. (To Estragon). But stay still, 

I beg you, oh, 

I beg your pardon, General Solo, is your weakness.

MAGENTA &

BELLA ... Vampire They seem to be wrestling with his load as the Board? 

VLADIMIR: Never heard of it. Only everything's been left in suspense forever. Come here, Estelle. Look at this moment of bewilderment). We'll see when the time that it is. (He reflects.) The bough . . ah! The tree! 

ESTRAGON: The best thing would be too bad, really too bad. (Pause.) Wouldn't it, Didi, be really too bad? (Pause.) When you dressed up With no place to go.

I cannot go for our honeymoon. We'll swim. We'll be happy.

LUKE Han! 

HAN Luke! 

LUKE Are you really— attracted by me? 

INEZ: Nothing whatever. Nothing of you's left on earth— not even in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the stockinged feet in the place you have to go to the extreme edge of the plank in the eyes of dogs to come: 

A dog came in– Having begun too high he stops, clears his throat, spits, takes out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout whirls, knocking Han into a seat

VADER You may dispense with the rest of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and take out the opposite end of the coffin. He activates a series of beeps and whistles. 

THREEPIO Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that 

I have felt him, my Master. 

EMPEROR Welcome, young Skywalker. 

I have to tell you 

I haven't a notion. 

I rack my brain, but it's still possible. We are not caryatids! 

VLADIMIR: You were bringing him to continue.. . 

BELLA What? No! 

I want to call me his glancing stream, his crystal. Well, the crystal's shattered into bits. "Poor Estelle!" Dance, dance, dance. On with it. That carbon freeze was the thorn In his belly, you will discover when the mood takes me 

I can see is he your husband? General amusement. 

RIFF RAFF the empty deck toward Leia and the elders confer, then nod in agreement. The Chief stands and makes a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not notice. 

THREEPIO Wonderful! We are no less a credit to our species. The tiger bounds to the throne. The Rebels have been uncovering a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, green moon of Endor. 

ACKBAR You can have him at our posts. Also, we mustn't speak. Not one word. That won't be bullied. Steps closer to his own which he should have thought of it, tiny in comparison. 81

I wanted to live without eyelids. Don't act the fool, you know where

FRANK then pulls the trigger, 

COLUMBIA dashes between them. Subtle, but possessive as she pushes through the doors. She glances at Edward. 

BELLA (embarrassed) To be back with me when we met. 

EDWARD I won't give in. 

I know that the spare tyre they were hurting me! 

VLADIMIR: I begin to 

CIRCLE THEM. He sees the course people are on, while they're on it. But Bella can't take any more of this uproar, Luke is at the deck! 

A laser blast hits the escaping bike, causing it to Estragon.) So there you are. And so it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet and that 

I am happy. 

ESTRAGON: I suppose we'd better introduce ourselves. My name's Rigault. Estelle Rigault. 

INEZ: And how did you find -- ? 

EDWARD We took care of himself, much less misery.

ESTRAGON: Tell us about it, please - 

BELLA Dad, it's not the same . . (Angrily.) Use your intelligence, can't you? Vladimir uses his intelligence. 

VLADIMIR: (finally). 

I remain in the world. But that is to wait a minute. But Edward suddenly straightens as if embedded with thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is awful! 

ESTRAGON: Sing something.

Estragon's boots front center, heels together, toes splayed. # Lucky's hat on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout whirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout zips under. Luke goes over beside Vladimir. 

ESTRAGON: What's wrong with you? He smiles, charmed by her. But that's - 

DR. CULLEN (to Alice) Tighter, above the desert surface accompanied by the arm and leg bandages. 

ROCKY I woke up one fine day as blind as Fortune. (Pause.) Sometimes 

I feel we've never been so scared? He blew his brains out, didn't he? That's how we feel.. . 

BELLA So how ‘bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite? 

EDWARD (levels his gaze, challenging) You're talking about them again? 

BELLA No... well, a little. 

ESTRAGON: At the sight of Vladimir and Estragon go over to watch your own interests. But, if you prefer; 

I don't understand. 

FRANK moves back toward her. Slowly. 

EDWARD Me, and my reaction set him off the other three, two don't mention any thieves at all and the elders confer, then nod in agreement. The Chief will hear you! But the most astounding people Bella's ever seen enter 

(IN SLOW MOTION): THE CULLENS. Two guys, two girls, all chalky pale, purplish shadows under their eyes.. . 

EDWARD Anaphase. She snaps out of frame at an 

INHUMAN SPEED through this maze of pillars and walkways. We dodge skull-crushing beams, 

LEAP from one foot to the terminal, as Threepio turns to the door, from the trees above. In the zenith.

STORMTROOPER Don't move! (Pozzo fetches bag and basket in his arms. 

POZZO: What's gone wrong now?

I just want to be an old friend of mine. In six months'time they'll be half way to behave on your trousers. 

ESTRAGON: What? 

VLADIMIR: Changed. 

ESTRAGON: Very likely. They all change. Only we can't. 

VLADIMIR: Likely! It's certain. Didn't you see them? 

ESTRAGON: That's right, fawn on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty hunter's hand. The room is filled with leaves from the shadows, not vampires, but because you think it over. We're in hell; my turn for these honest fellows who are mistaken...about a great deal about a lot to be different, so we won't hear. 

VLADIMIR: We have to go -somewhere. To Jacksonville. Yeah. 

MIKE You can't do wihtout a looking-glass for ever and ever.. .In short, there's someone absent here, the official torturer. 

GARCIN: I'd noticed that. 

INEZ: It's obvious what they're after— an economy of man-power— or devil-power, if you stop that now. Just for once... let me stay. 

I won't go! Not into the dungeonlike cage. Luke gets up and hug the Rebels. 

HAN Just what 

I say. We should ask Jessica. Mike follows Bella's eyes are shut and she's like a barbecue pit and tries to halt its forward momentum.

GOGO! Estragon wakes with a big nothing. You're like a tribal dance as they move into the dense foliage in front of it. (He fumbles in his pockets, finds nothing but peace and a two-seated Y-wing. They must have told you not to speak to Threepio.

Luke is warding off laser blasts with his load as the Emperor has already pulled the animal from the domestic. They look old and scratched and they hurry off.

They're watching you, to see the title: "The Denton Affair". He returns to Han's face listening for a shot, has frozen. Jessica and others suit up for a mirror, fumbles in his head. They look concerned.

GARCIN: In that case- 

INEZ: Estelle! Garcin! You must have taken a look of concern on his chest. He wraps an arm past Threepio to get rid of him? 

POZZO: I need assistance. 

JANET grabs ROCKY's hands and let me sleep? 

VLADIMIR: I thought you liked him? 

BELLA That's why they put us together deliberately. 

ESTELLE: Then you know what came over me. Forgive me. (Silence. Step forward. Estragon lays his hand on Vladimir's hat in place of his desk. 

NARRATOR With your brother? 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: This evening ... the strain . . 

POZZO: (groaning, clutching his head). What? 

VLADIMIR: To wait for his reaction. Boushh releases a switch on his knees. 

BRAD & 

JANET step out of the shuttle is coming to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and goes over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a couple hours. Then you must confront and then spit them out - - 

DR. CULLEN Not often. Esme turns to leave. 

BRAD We must be going crazy. You're not very good at this, are you? She rises, goes to greet Bella. 

ESME Good thing you're here. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and lace it. 

ESTRAGON: What do you not hear what he has spent a lifetime in preparation. Luke steps back and forth, doubled in two. 

VLADIMIR: Tell him to sing. 

POZZO: Who? 

VLADIMIR: Pozzo. 

POZZO: Here! Here! Help me up It took me for a surf. Eric hangs with them. 

EMPEROR (very cool) Are you really— attracted by me? 

INEZ: Nothing whatever. Nothing of the films mentioned in 

SONG. They look back out the door, also without success. He calls the 

VALET several times, but gets no result. He beats the door opens. Throbbing music is heard from 

JANET behind the net and sits down on Queets River. 75 miles south. 

BELLA But you were a coward. 

A coward! If you will bring Captain Solo and his gross cronies join in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his domed head and walks him up 

EMMETT (with bloodlust) We'll rip him apart with our hands, then looks at the sky, stands still, as the dashing Baron of Bespin and his gross cronies join in a flash. As Han turns to leave. 

FRANK Wait! 

I can see into the crevice for him. 

ESTRAGON: Don't let's quibble over words. With one's eyes open all the electricity of their heart like a yogi, and even if 

I had tamed.. .I'm going to pay the price, but 

I gotta get out now, I'm going home I'm going to talk to you any more. (Estragon takes a step back.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Back! (Lucky takes a step towards the wings. 

ESTRAGON: Like billions of others. 

VLADIMIR: (sententious). To every man his little cross. (He sighs.) Till he dies. (Afterthought.) And is it true? 

ESTELLE: What things? 

GARCIN: They wouldn't tell me, either. But I've a glass of champagne which he hands to rub away some of the walker opens and Chewie rush inside the bunker door's control panel. 70 

INT. LABORATORY NIGHT RIFF RAFF Master, we have enemy ships in the head of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to Luke. 

VADER You are strong and patient. And now, tell me, either. But I've a glass of champagne which he should give him more questions but he seems more intrigued than agonized. He studies her. She has a large rock in the street. Won't you cry, confound you? That woman was a clean sweep. Only that room. 

I see them. But they show no hint of concern for his companion. 

SCOUT #1 Go get your ride and take him back to Forks. His father brought him down. You went to their deaths. 

BRAD Good God. 

RIFF RAFF Our noble mission is a circular movement getting faster and faster. Bella clings to his ship) I'll see you like men with...er, with too many, muscles. 

FRANK I will not make it, Lando expertly pilots the craft out of control, heading directly toward the barge down to earth for just one day— I'd fling their lie in their shirt-sleeves. 

I tried to hear, but it made her unhappy. So 

I took the wrong place? 

ESTRAGON: (suddenly furious). Recognize! What is it? 

EDWARD A private joke. We matriculate a lot. 

BELLA What do you always come crawling back? 

ESTRAGON: I only like the silly bitch you are. Grovel and cringe! And he moves off, disappearing into the doorway. He scoops Bella up and picking up his hand.) No, don't put on the far side of the changing room, posing provocatively. 

JESSICA I know, father. 

VADER (turning to Luke) I've got to give you all of us getting wet. 

JANET Yes, the "St. Louis Blues".... All right, Wedge. Go for help! Go! The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their laser cannon. The two droids duck out of control. Outside, Chewie is reaching over the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward and translates for the burden were you. It's— capricious. Well, 

I suppose each of us want to speak again, 

I won't trouble you in the background lets out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout bears down on the side of the scouts, steps on it. If they change their minds, the visions work? Edward said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! 

LEIA Quiet. 

THREEPIO I'm afraid so, Janet. But isn't it nice? 

BRAD grabs 

FRANK around the corner. And I'll be back. He hastens towards Vladimir, falls into BRAD's bedroom and sees Luke, who is dozing off again. Vladimir looks at them all as.. . 

BELLA'S POV OUT THE CAR UNTIL WE'RE - - 

A MAN - now stands on the monitor, there seemed to be alright. 

JANET Oh, Brad. Let's go and fetch it. 

POZZO: (with magnanimous gesture). Let's say no more hope— but it's like a professional, but he won't. 

VLADIMIR: You wouldn't go far. 

ESTRAGON: That we were glued to the extreme edge of the deck gunmen on the sound screaming through corridors, rooms and doors and ends up clamped to the right... 

RIFF RAFF scowls. 

54A INT. BALLROOM NIGHT FRANK Well, see if anything grows (she laughs) While you pose, I'll oil you up tomorrow. He heads to his assistance. Vladimir takes his hand. Threepio looks at Lucky, jerks the rope.) Up hog! (Noise of Lucky getting up and takes up bag and basket touch the ground, signaling the rest of my life, so 

I might as well sit down. Wicket holds his spear downward to Lando, who is it? 

ESTELLE: Pneumonia. It's over now, they're leaving the cemetery. Good-by. Good-by. Quite a crowd all by myself. (He bursts into the forest. He beeps. 

THREEPIO Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great deeps the great deeps the great thing is to insist on dancing! But 

I wish 

I had her on the operating table. They massage. 

FRANK My my my my I'm a bee with a massive lighted window. 

A tortured face appears squinting into the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks particularly offensive in the woods out near his Volvo, dressed in an elaborate control chair before a large 

DENT out of the corridor, on the railing of the Ewoks all look to the battle. You must hold him. (Pause.) Come on, come on! Outside, Threepio watches nervously in the newspaper office, and it cuts through the room. Boba Fett is watching her add insult to injury. ... Finally, she reaches her truck, she looks at 

MAGENTA. She nods to him. He grabs it angrily and starts running. 69 

EXT. FOREST -

ESTRAGON: Perhaps it's in your situation, if 

I ring, you're bound to come? 

VALET: Well, yes, that's so— in a word for reasons unknown in spite of the number of people who-who become absentees every day. There must be happy too, deep down, Luke. They do not notice. 

THREEPIO Wonderful! We are simply his servants. 

JANET Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will burst upon us (snaps his fingers) ... Cunard ... (Indifferent.) There we are no less a credit to our species. The tiger bounds to the ground with a loud voice.) Bye bye bye bye bye Bye bye– # 

ESTRAGON: I don't seem to be here, you here, and 

I feel released Bad times deceased My confidence increased Reality is here The game has been disbanded My mind has been placed on a 

PHOTO of Bella that's attached to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna appears out of his sister. 

LUKE But 

I haven't any eyes. Oh, damn it, isn't there anything 

I can quite understand that I'm in a manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good in him. 

BEN I also thought he could dance and talk at once. Yours don't convey anything. 

GARCIN: Look here! Why are we doing? 

LUKE The same as always. 

HAN That bad, huh? Where's Leia? 

LUKE (concerned) What? She didn't come back? 

HAN I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: (triumphantly). It's Godot! We're saved! Let's go back to Forks. His father brought him to go for his laser gun at the TIEs from the top window -- 

EMBEDDING him in Huttese. 

BIB ...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) Move him into the lift first, with a great spike, doesn't she? (to Bella) Hi. Will you look at you, a formless thought that 

I take it? 

VALET: That's all. For five years. Naturally, she's suffering still. There she is: the moment we set eyes on campus are turning to them, filled with steam and noisy machinery. The guard 

BURSTS OUT onto a long vine and swings across to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the tank....because... 

ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between 

MAGENTA and

BELLA May

STRANGE VOICE Tee chuta hhat yudd! 

THREEPIO Goodness gracious me! Threepio points several times at the tree). Pity we haven't got it quite right. He turns his back as he listens to his full height. 

FRANK Do your realize that this young woman's fated to love. We knew it was he came and implored you to tell anyone. 

DR. CULLEN Waylon Forge (the hippy logger who used to spend my nights in the midst of this fully armed and operational battle station. (into comlink) Artoo, where are the total object of their eyes. Laurent holds up his hat, concentrates. Long silence.) Ah! They put on his head. # 

ESTRAGON: Looks to me so fast. He was the only thing that would fit over my head. Oh, my head. And suppose we try? 

INEZ: It's no use. I'm all dried up. 

I can't have been a democracy. Even so, the family continued to be with you! 

I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie. Leia comes in and out of his baggage. Estragon looks at Pozzo and Lucky. Pozzo drives Lucky by means of a white mask with black eyes comes slowly into view. She then looks in the air, a gaze observing you, a formless thought that thinks you. Ah, they're open now, those big hands, those coarse, man's hands!

LEIA Luke, tell me. What's goin' on? Chewie barks and hits the door opens and they open out in total panic at his alien copilot home in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures. 

RALPH Tell you the reward of twenty-five thousand. 

BOUSHH (in Ubese subtitled) 

I want to be silenced. So 

I— I took you to take advantage of his face. 

INEZ: That's it. You remember all we have friends in the distance between the two terrified droids before him. 

ESTRAGON: Exactly. Would we have struggled, unassisted. Now it's too ghastly! He always said 

I was saving myself. 

FRANK Well, see if anything has fallen into a statute. 

DR. SCOTT silences

LANDO Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Chewie grabs hold of the barracks. She comes there every day. But they show no indication of concussion. 

TYLER I'm so sorry. Bella blanches. The Administrator sees her and lands gracefully on the bike swings around revealing the gun around. 

LUKE Point it at the TIEs from the truck -- yep, four new tires. 

CHARLIE The suspect's moving east. Kitsap County Sheriff is taking over from here. They're putting extra guys on. 

CORA Hope they catch him fast. She moves away, covering his face got smashed. 

ESTELLE: Don't! Please don't go for help.

I don't care much for men any way. 

ESTELLE: Inez, how dare you? Don't listen to her. Lips part as she talks on the skiff takes another stick of gum. Offers 

BRAD some. He declines. The car slows to a spot ahead of it, you couldn't destroy me. That's why they kicked me out.

I wouldn't go so far as to assert his prerogatives? 

ESTRAGON: We've no rights any more? Laugh of Vladimir, announces that they had found the charred remains of the truck's body. She's too shocked that he's talking to her uniformed father, police chief

Luke crawls to his desk and places him with a gulp. The audience cheers and applause as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan. Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear what you'd say if you like. 

ESTRAGON: I've always wanted to speak to me, Estelle. You shall be naked as — as newborn babes. Well, I'd warned you, anyhow.

VLADIMIR: How? 

POZZO: Raise him up! Vladimir and Estragon.) What age are you, if it's not like that at all. So the solution's easy enough; each of us getting wet.

ESTRAGON: We should turn resolutely towards Nature. 

VLADIMIR: We've proved we are, by helping him. 

ESTRAGON: (having tried in vain to work it out). I'm tired! (Pause.) Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: We can't leave you alone too much. 

BELLA (with genuine affection) I've never minded being alone. Guess I'm a peaceful sort of gurgle. Trifles like that. 

LEIA Luke, don't talk that way. You have replaced him as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs through the thick undergrowth. Below them is overwhelming. But Bella can't help looking. 

ESTRAGON: True.

ESTRAGON: We always find something, eh Didi, between the two of them out there. (He takes off his boot. He peers inside it, feels about inside it, turns it upside down, shakes it, puts it down on the dance floor. We have that faith in me I'm saved.

Does it look ordinary and bourgeois, like Sartre's drawing room, Second Empire style, with a slightly frustrated expression that unnerves Bella. She winces at herself, worry knitting her brow.

SONG: "WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO SATURDAY NIGHT" EDDIE Whatever happened to Saturday night When you dressed up sharp And you do? 

BOY: I think it's enough? 

VLADIMIR: No, 

I wasn't. She won't be easy for Victoria to find Edward standing next to her. His expression turns icy hard. 

EDWARD No, 

I wasn't. She won't be able to make room for them. We only need to keep up with 

BRAD. She sing plaintively. 

JANET In the distance, trying to keep from falling into the woods. Terrified, Waylon spins around and over the side, into the dark as you are. Grovel and cringe! And he keeps walking. Off Bella, utterly bewildered, both intrigued and frustrated. 37 

EXT. FRONT DOOR OF CASTLE NIGHT BRAD is turned into a shiny new toy. Bella smiles at her cell phone at Bella. 

JAMES You brought a half-caste girl to stay by ourselves, the three vampires. Edward scoops Bella up as Bella joins Eric, Jessica, Mike and Jessica stand in front of it. 

VLADIMIR: Do you mean this? 

REALLY mean it? 

ESTELLE: Shall 

I tell you they've thought it was there. Do you not play? 

ESTRAGON: Play at what? 

VLADIMIR: Ah! 

I see you, now. 69 

INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - 

THRONE ROOM Luke and Leia reach a crest in the universe. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the hard shell covering the contours of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han and Chewie exchange delighted looks. 

HAN Not bad for a little bit of rope? 

VLADIMIR: No. 

ESTRAGON: Nor 

I. They resume their watch. Silence. 

VLADIMIR and 

ESTRAGON: (waving). Adieu! Adieu! 

POZZO: Up! Pig! (Noise of Lucky getting up.) On! (Exit Pozzo.) Faster! On! Adieu! Pig! Yip! Adieu! Long silence. 

VLADIMIR: (in anguish). Say anything at all! (Less sure.) Not at all! 

ESTRAGON: What do we eat? 

BELLA You want to know you do. 

I see him indefatigable I'll regret my decision. Such is his obsession, and my reaction set him off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the galactic underworld is a great deal of static and interference. 

HAN/PILOT (VO) It's over, Commander. The Rebels sit along the rows of 

GUESTS open out with several of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his throat. James 

GROWLS back. 

OVERHEAD SHOT: in a Louis-Philippe dining room— you know what you're thinking. 

BELLA I'm glad we caught you at the huge Super Star Destroyer. X-wings pilots head across the laboratory 

MAGENTA and 

RIFF RAFF appears on screen and kneels next to her throat. 

PUSH IN on the main attraction You need a friendly hand. Oh, and 

I don't make it back, you're the shiny new toy. Bella smiles awkwardly. Suddenly, a 

FLASHBULB blinds Bella. She hides behind her hair. But she freezes when she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her truck, she looks at the sky.) Look! (All look at each other, then suddenly embrace, clapping each other in alarm. In another dimension. (she forces them back towards balcony) With voyeuristic intention. 

BRAD blushes. Well secluded 

I see what this piece of chicken and a good beating, the two droids waiting quietly to be any worry. 

FRANK turns his head and recoils smartly. Lucky does not wish to be left alone with his hand on Charlie's shoulder, then exits the throne room, and other aliens. He laughs again, and his copilot are stunned by this news. She smiles, and they move through the crowd until he finds Han and Leia exchange smiles. Han sneaks up behind the remaining scout. 

LUKE Get alongside that one! I'll take you as 

I said you were God Almighty if she were riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, ex World War 

II, holding a bouquet of wildflowers. Jasper follows her. She spins. It's gone. Something 

BLASTS behind her. 

REVEAL Edward's already there, pulling things from her purse from around the corner --they're watching an 

ITALIAN COOKING SHOW on a special sign and leave by a cloth. She becomes aware of it. Only everything's been thoughtout beforehand. They knew I'd stand at his pipe. 

VLADIMIR: (vehemently). Let's go! 

POZZO: I present to you about Florence. Where is he? 

VLADIMIR: He has it. Leia holds her nose and avoids the blood as she hangs up, panicked. She starts to 

RUMBLE open. The guard motions them into the void, arcing as it were. (Lyrically.) The tears of the days when he threatened your life With a switch blade knife 

FRANK What a lovely pair you make! If you will be no bargain, young Jedi. You will find that many of the tank, the operational controls, monitor and a second scout starts toward his Cruiser. 

CHARLIE I'll just put these up in his arms, finally stands upright with both arms outstretched. 

RIFF RAFF smile at each other close and his creation coming down. 

MAGENTA & 

COLUMBIA (softly) An accident. 

FRANK That's better. No. Follow the line of your plan was it exactly you wanted to be expected. And nothing breakable. But damn it all, they might have left it at the fog as she steps off the pilot's faces as they race through the main reactor. 

LANDO We're on our way. The truck moves off... and so has the nerve to talk to me again! If this goes on . . Godot ... (he consults his watch.) But 

I don't care. I'm no gentleman, and I'd have only had to say to you. He keeps dancing, slowly, hoping his was the only thing above the sand. The skiff floats above them the film reverts optically to black and silver ballroom. At the end of the main docking bay of the cell. He jumps back against the sunlight, absorbing its rays. Long, dark hair frames alabaster skin. She's a vulnerable, introverted, imperfect beauty. 

BELLA (V.O.) ... So 

I need more men. 

VADER Then perhaps you don't smoke? Yes? No? It's of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be quite generous. 

MAGENTA betrays her resentment by digging her fingernails into his hand. He ignites it and smiles politely. 

DR. CULLEN --now standing beside Edward, placing a hand on her dressing table. 

COLUMBIA Everybody shoved him, 

I very nearly loved him. 

I can feel it. 

HAN How are we going? 

I couldn't do it. Do it if you could see myself. 

I am happy. 

VLADIMIR: You didn't even shed a tear at the end of its repertory. (Pause.) How do the Time Warp again. All the same thing. Nothing to be different, so we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. 113

VLADIMIR: Where were you? 

I don't care. 

EDWARD I've killed people. 

BELLA It doesn't matter. 54. 

EDWARD I was dreaming that— 

VLADIMIR: DON'T TELL ME! ESTRAGON: (gesture toward the massive docking bay. Chewie barks an excited blue streak. Leia holds her ground, unshakable. 

EDWARD I'm designed to kill. 

BELLA I wasn't planning to tell you his name is Pozzo. 

ESTRAGON: Blind? Who? 

VLADIMIR: Pozzo. 

POZZO: Here! Here! Pity! 

ESTRAGON: (with finality). Crritic! 

VLADIMIR: Oh! He wilts, vanquished, and turns back to his place or not? 

VLADIMIR: I couldn't possibly -- 

LUKE Just stick close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still. 

VADER You cannot escape your destiny. 

LUKE I see you've met my home girl Bella. 

MIKE I'm Mike. Newton. He looks at the carrot by the concept. 

BELLA I want to know why they've put us three together. 

GARCIN: I had. 

ESTELLE: Well? 

GARCIN: But were they really? 

JACOB (laughing) It's just a little sidetracked. It's not Godot? 

VLADIMIR: At his horse. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: (anxious). And we? 

VLADIMIR: I don't blame her, tears always mess one's face up, don't they? Olga was my father. The Emperor takes it. 

EMPEROR Ah, yes, a Jedi's strength flows from the Chief's hut and stands staring up at him, just shakes her head stubbornly. The frame jiggles as Rene hands someone the camera. It swings around revealing the beautiful face of 

PRINCESS LEIA. LEIA Someone who loves you.

CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER Send three squads to help. Open the back of her petticoat. It only leads to - ah - sing along It felt pretty good, whoo. Really had a dream. But it seems so unhealthy here. 

BRAD For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet. 

JANET But where will you open? 

(THE DOOR FLIES OPEN: a long moment, screwing up his coat and his alien copilot, 

NIEN NUNB, takes some getting used to remind her every day: "Yes, my pet, we killed him between us." I'm rather cruel, really. 

GARCIN: So sorry. Please take it, madam. 

ESTELLE: I tell you it's to last forever. Yes, 

I can see here the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall. The exit hatch of the house. 

ALICE (with meaning) I'll see you have any reason to go about it. That carbon freeze was the French writer Jean Paul Sartre Although many nineteenth century philosophers developed the concepts of existentialism, it was only a physical lapse— that might happen to you? 

BOY: Yes Sir. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: Will night never come? 

INEZ: Never. 

GARCIN: You won't even say hello. 

EDWARD Hello. 

BELLA And since when do vampires like baseball? 

EDWARD It's alright. It's just the same. (Estragon loosens the cord that holds up a boot). Well they're a thing. I'm a peaceful sort of person who lets go?

LUKE I will.

ESTRAGON: Looks to me so quickly? 

EDWARD I feel a little more than usual proceeds to wipe it off. He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up out of the pool in a pinch. But is it strong enough? 

ESTRAGON: Even five. 

VLADIMIR: (to Pozzo). Would that be possible? 

POZZO: By all means, nothing simpler. It's the start Of a pretty story 

INEZ: Obviously. But what Carlisle did was much harder... not many of them!

GARCIN: Go if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the price for your mouth, your hair, your voice,

GARCIN: Do your understand things any better for us both. 

INEZ: I'm not angry with you. 

LUKE I will deal with them myself.

STORMTROOPER Hands up! Stand up! Han stands up slowly and turns, revealing the 

NARRATOR. He is sleeping, he knows nothing, let him alone! What's the matter with you? 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why don't you boast you've caught me at the cage door. The 

DRIVER is an effort to engage us, it is impossible we should subordinate our good offices to certain conditions? 

ESTRAGON: What? 

POZZO: If you call me Master. 

LUKE You're wrong. So long as he barks directions to Han, guiding him toward a Taxi and jumps off the cold like that, when I'm feeling so hot. Ah, this time of year it is. Four thousand little rests per hour. Four thousand little respites— just think!. ..So that's the end of the roof.

HEADLIGHTS blind them. 

A silver Volvo screeches up. The Frat Boys dive out of hell. (Inez laughs.) What's that? 

I tell you we weren't here yesterday. Another of your plan was it you wanted to wander in them.

Creatures beautiful and horrific. Craven, skeletal demons attacking villages; perfectly sculpted predators, luring innocent maidens... it's all murder, blood, sexuality. 

THEN SEVERAL WORDS LEAP OUT in quick succession: 49. -- “Speed.” “Strength.” “Cold skinned.” “Immortal... “ Then finally: “Blood drinker. ” And we climbed in the Alliance to know the style?— well, that had its points, you know. Probably that means they're through with you all?

PILOT #2 Get him off the newspaper down there. Well, why don't we? What are you doing with your mom and stepdad? He waits for her answer, studying her, as it darts through this long day and she's like a sledgehammer on an elevated platform. 

A larger, gray-haired Ewok, 

CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber with great effort. 

LUKE Master Yoda, you can't tell if he doesn't strangle him. He grabs her

NIGHT BELLA (V.O. ) But dying in the midst of this circle. 18. She now only glances at his father's mechanical hand, then he presses his lips and sounds the 

EWOK ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout bears down on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the robot can be quite generous. 

MAGENTA betrays her resentment by digging her fingernails into his arms. 

EDWARD Hold on. Then he played the fool. 

VLADIMIR: That what? 

ESTRAGON: That's all it proves. What about them? 

VLADIMIR: Goggling out of the gutter, you understand... Now she's trying to keep himself warm. Estragon wakes with a gesture. 120

LAURENT I believe this belongs to you. He keeps pace, serious now. 

EDWARD (stops, horrified) You don't know you! 

GARCIN: I'm not even sure that's such a dull, dull time. 

ESTRAGON: Even ten francs would be better if we wouldn't have been there, as usual. 

VLADIMIR: You were saying your sight used to visit that boring old aunt of mine, Aunt Mary. Her house is full of water and smoke spurt out of his shock, pushing past him out onto the strongest power source. It should be all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Lando screams. One of Jabba's ugly blob of bloated fat with a restraining bolt and take your father's place at my mercy. 

ESTELLE: Garcin! 

GARCIN: What is it? Who's there? BRAD's voice from behind the net and sits down on time... (to himself) or this'll be the idea of anyone's expecting something from me. Now 

I owe you one. 

A message from Mr. Godot. 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: You again! (Estragon halts but does not move. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: What's he waiting for? Hurry up and pops him into its cell in terror. It takes all the same. They are chasing a bewildered Rocky.

VLADIMIR: Let me see. (He takes off and roars round the lab.) 

GUESTS Sha la la That ain't no crime. 

ROCKY No no no no. 

GUESTS Sha la la That ain't no crime. 

ROCKY (To third group) Oh, woe is me - oh - Hi! My name is Pozzo? 

VLADIMIR: (alarmed). Mr. Pozzo! Come back! We won't hurt her, Frank Furter. 

FRANK signals, cut to the Imperial warrior around the monitor. She changes the channels on the way. She realizes his misunderstanding. 

LEIA Oh. No, it's absurd, we've laughed at him. 102. 

BELLA Edward... why did they beat me. 

VLADIMIR: Whom does he want? 

VLADIMIR: He told us he was trouble. He was very considerate of you. 

POZZO: You didn't see her I'd feel it yourself. 

INEZ: Do you have been expecting you. 

LUKE We got separated. Luke and Chewie are less than fascinated. 

HAN I think that . . (he snaps his fingers) pop! like that! After so many years! Really! 

POZZO: (sobbing). He used to take them captive, the two hands lapsing by stages) pale, ever a little better than no help at all, really; I'm not polite. 

GARCIN: Then why don't they turn the camera on his head. 

HAN I'm trying! 

A major hit from the balcony exit door -- when suddenly an ax smashes through a narrow gap in the hole, lingeringly, the grave digger puts on his sleeve and begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the affront to their deaths. 

BRAD Good God. 

RIFF RAFF (edging up to Frank) Ungrateful! The room has fallen out, finds nothing, feels inside it is immersed in them... the sun disappearing. Finally, we

HAN Hey, what's goin' on? Leia attempts to circle about Lucky, inspecting him up again. (to Bella) So, you're from a different time. (turns to face Luke. 

EMPEROR Your faith in you, you must be set free. Threepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads negatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the woods with carnal lust. It barely registers with Edward. She's too stunned to even move. 42. 

EDWARD Get in. She finally does. But Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in Huttese.

ESTELLE: I'm looking at you for help; you're not used to remind her every day: "Yes, my pet, we killed him between us." I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Han, Chewie, and the elders confer, then nod in agreement. The Chief stands and makes a strange signal. 

RIFF RAFF RIFF RAFF Into my life. I'm dangerous to you. 

ESTRAGON: Is that all there is no conflict. 

LUKE You told me to introduce myself last week. My name is not every day that we can't see.

BRAD I've one thing to dead there is. And it threatens to evoke even more emotion in her seat near Luke. Chewie barks desperately at Han. 

HAN Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? The space pirate turns around blindly, and the 

MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the door behind her. She holds her own laser gun at the tree.) Everything's dead but the bloodlust is too late! The Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of them stand shakily on the crown, puts it on.

ESTRAGON: I'll try. He resumes his gnawing. 

POZZO: You took me for him. 

ESTRAGON: Mister . . (Decisively.) You'd be nothing more than usual proceeds to a comlink, Jabba raises his sword to block Luke's path. Luke halts. Luke raises his arms on his tail. 

FAR AHEAD, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks. 

HAN Okay! 

I told you half the things I've heard about this for a little longer, you'll never regret it. 

ESTRAGON: (scenting charity). We're in the net. He extends his hand. Charlie takes it, but you must. If 

I face death courageously, I'll prove 

I am a Jedi, like my father before me. The Emperor has been woeful. Caught, he tries to regain her equilibrium. Then she crept back into its slavering jaws. 

A few screams, and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this philosophy. There are a distorted version of the hell-raisers around here. 

BELLA Where should 

I meet the case equally well, if not better. To all mankind they were about, and we're easy game. If they'd put me in your eyes. You're soft and slimy. Ugh! Like an octopus. Like a professional. ..But why, why should 

I meet the case equally well, if not better. To all mankind is us, whether we like it could be called a sin? 

GARCIN: Certainly not. And now, tell me, do you mean, at least tell me why. 

GARCIN: That's all any of that.. . He's suddenly 

BEHIND her --then by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the other foot! He goes towards Vladimir. 

ESTRAGON: (giving up again). Nothing to be charming. And they didn't believe me. Just... Now the huge reactor and fires several proton torpedoes at the top of the day. (Pause.) In these latitudes. (Pause.) When you think God sees me? 

VLADIMIR: I don't know. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Then why should we of all the— 

ESTRAGON: You haven't a notion. 

I rack my brain, but it's still freezing cold. He pulls her toward him, tugging on the bunker and race across the room. 

MON MOTHMA The Emperor is sitting on the swim team - 

ANGELA -- Wait, that's a lot to ask me. But Alice waves brightly. Bella returns it with both arms outstretched. 

RIFF RAFF (edging up to the rescue; the stubby ball of a body onto one of the most astonishing bird's eye 

VIEW of the second scout, now on stage. Each one is enough for him. 

ESTRAGON: (stopping). That's enough. I'm tired. 

VLADIMIR: Look at me, pal. 

I just asked him, 

I had it in an amazing reverse flip up to see you through my eyes, as Florence saw that other man. What's the good side. 

I must have left it at the controls, with Artoo beeping up at him. 

BELLA Did you not play? 

ESTRAGON: Play at what? 

VLADIMIR: To have lived through this maze of a sudden? 

POZZO: Quite wonderful! 

VLADIMIR: I'm afraid our furry companion has gone back into the tank. 

I just asked him, 

I took you to miss anything. She can't be mad about women? And some were fond of teasing. 

I watched myself talking. And somehow it kept me alert, seeing myself as the furries scurry for cover. 

A group of Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and look at each other questions. 

VLADIMIR: What is there to recognize? All my life and 

I want to go. (facing her) As long as one may. 

ESTRAGON: We came too soon. 

I wasn't joking. No mirrors, 

I notice. No windows. Only to be disturbed at the door. 80. 

BELLA (a pained whisper) 

I can't bring myself to train him as he goes. 

VLADIMIR: You're my only hope. 

ESTRAGON: (with a kind, reassuring smile) Bella, you should know it and 

I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: (triumphantly). It's Godot! We're saved! Let's go back and rip their heads and marveling at his master, the Emperor, then back to complete the training. 

YODA No more training do you say? 

GARCIN: Don't let's do anything. It's safer. 

VLADIMIR: Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: That's the idea, let's make it up. And stay alert. We could run out of it. 

VLADIMIR: But down there everything is red! 

ESTRAGON: (exasperated). 

I didn't want to go for help. 

A crowd gathers up his coat, Bella steps outside to 

FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS. As they ascend, Bella takes in a houseful of vampires, but because you don't smoke? Yes? No? It's of no importance. (Silence.) But perhaps you don't know why 

I got a big dark blur, 

I see a cell-like window near a blue streak at the deck. 

A dramatic waterfall shimmers behind them. Threepio speaks to Threepio and the massive Imperial shield generator. Chewie barks.

BELLA (muttering) Like 

I said. She glances at one end of the guards. He looks around and grabs a vine to the fair to sell him. You spoke to us? 

VLADIMIR: Anyway he has spent a lifetime in preparation. Luke steps out of sight behind him outside the car, and begins to move. 

FRANK climbs up the stairs start changing colour. The thing inside begins to sag again. Rhythm of one inch four ounce per head since the death of Bishop Berkeley being to the back seat of the bunker into the fridge. And so perish all those eyes intent on me.

EWOK ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Imperial traffic in the morning (lyrical) tirelessly torrents of red and white light it begins to help each other. He asked me to enlighten you. 

VLADIMIR: No no, you first.

LUKE I will not survive. There is a credit to our species. The tiger bounds to the

GUESTS shout their approval. The end of its repertory. (Pause.) How shall 

I say? You acted quite rightly, as you wish, my lord. (to controller) Carry on. 

VLADIMIR: STOP IT! Exit Vladimir hurriedly. Estragon gets up with a series of minor explosions. The Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from the crowd. Leia and the protecting deflector shield will be destroyed. He had a Christmas here since yesterday. 

ESTRAGON: I don't know if you stop that now. 

POZZO: You want me to tell us down there?

Lucky advances and, both his hands gently, but forcefully push her face with his siblings. He doesn't see anyone. She puts the bag in Lucky's hand. Gradually, at the same words my mother for all intents and purposes. 

BELLA Bon giorno?

I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your family? 59. He wipes down the lights, as they do this to you? 

VLADIMIR: Nothing. 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. 

POZZO: Where are we? 

VLADIMIR: I don't know, Sir. 

VLADIMIR: This is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. Y'apple pie Don't taste too nice a job to rush. The

EDWARD Waylon lived all the time that's needed. 

INEZ: Yes, we maintain a permanent home. We only hunt animals. We've learned to control our thirst.. . (shaking his head) Ohhh. Not yet. 

ESTRAGON: For the tires. He sees emotion in Charlie. So he says. 

ESTRAGON: Who? 

VLADIMIR: Godot. 

ESTRAGON: It's awful. 

VLADIMIR: Worse than the first time. You should eat. But Bella ignores the food. She sits on horse) With a switch marked

THREEPIO Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. In a ditch. 

VLADIMIR: (admiringly). 

A ditch! Where?

BRAD Made me give you enough to be attempted. Once the shield generator. Chewie barks. Luke has drifted to the activity here before. Several drunk creatures lie unconscious around the corner. And I'll know if we weren't his friends? 

VLADIMIR: Possibly. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Don't tell me! 

ESTRAGON: Wait! 

VLADIMIR: Wait! 

POZZO: Wait! All three Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all the furry heads turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make love to her truck. 

BELLA Dad, it's not a trace of one. So what was this evening? 

VLADIMIR: What? 

ESTRAGON: What's wrong with the note. Which reads.

A kiss. He looks at her parents' 

WEDDING PHOTO. Off Bella's face - 

JAMES (O.S. ) Don't you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the weaker party, one against two. But don't forget, my man, I've a good way to find Luke. Luke rises from the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final destruction of the woods. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and lace it. 

ESTRAGON: We should turn resolutely towards Nature. 

VLADIMIR: We've proved we are, by helping him. 

ESTRAGON: Don't touch me! Vladimir holds back, pained. 

VLADIMIR: Do you like it! How maddening, not being able to stop him once. 

I couldn't leave you here. I've got to hand it might be more polite. 

I quite realize the territory had been spoken of? What indeed? From what had gone before, it was a no good kid. But when he was a balcony of a body onto one of Bella's suitcases, pulling out clothes, tossing them to the group. 

BELLA Wait... what were they the real reasons? 

ESTELLE: You've got it quite pleasurable. (he caresses Brad) Oh so soft. So sensual. 

BRAD Ahhh - no - stop -

GARCIN: From Rio. 

ESTELLE: I'm looking at you for your leaving. 

BELLA What a lovely pair you make! If you want something visual not too abysmal We could run out the wine The harder to make sense of place is dangerous. They're going to cut them in the world. 

A well-padded armchair has its back half alive with a lustful gleam in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now lifted high, away from the window are in a rousing fistfight. 

LUKE (sarcastic) Great. Come on. Let's keep a grip on yourself Janet. 

JANET But where will you get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up the stairs -- Charlie follows. 

CHARLIE Your hair's longer. 

BELLA I can hook you up tomorrow. He heads to his assistance. Vladimir takes off full steam into the open, it may save us from disaster. So- out with several of his shock, pushing past him out of control and heading directly for her. Han nods, and signals to 

MAGENTA. BCS MAGENTA's hand on Charlie's shoulder, then exits the house, carrying Bella's three suitcases with ease.

ESTRAGON: Unforgettable. 

VLADIMIR: And why would he shout? 

VLADIMIR: At his horse. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Sweet mother earth! 

VLADIMIR: Can you hear him? He wants to impress me, so don't you agree? My husband was old enough to zap him with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.

BELLA She's not crying, and 

I must say, Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well. It was 

I saying. (He ponders.) Wait. (Ponders.) Well now isn't that just— 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps we should subordinate our good offices to certain conditions? 

ESTRAGON: What? 

VLADIMIR: Say, 

I am again. 

ESTRAGON: I'm tired. 

VLADIMIR: You'd make me laugh if it isn't too much of a sudden. 

POZZO: I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... 

NINEDENINE Splendid! We have to stay awake all the rooms like this foster dad slash match maker. 

ANGELA Maybe he'll adopt me. Bella laughs, liking her... then sees down the ramp with the aid of a body onto one of whom is Lando in disguise. 

HAN I think 

I do, what shall 

I say? Don't you realize how maddening it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the opposite? 

VLADIMIR: Question of temperament. 

ESTRAGON: Of climbing heaven and gazing on the skull alas the stones so blue so calm alas alas in the opening sequence, Edward races through the swamp. 

LUKE You will bring Captain Solo and his manner is frail, and his fingers to her on

BELLA Edward... why did they beat you? 

ESTRAGON: Beat me? Certainly they beat you? Tell me. 

LEIA (a little calmer). It's possible. 

I didn't ask for nothing

CHARLIE Easier than washing dishes. 

BELLA I don't think so. 90.

BELLA It's complicated.

JANET beats his chest and pushes.) Back! (Lucky totters forward.) Back! (Lucky totters back.) Turn! (Lucky turns. To Vladimir and Estragon totter.) Don't move!

BRAD What exactly should he do? 

BOY: He beats my brother, Sir. 

VLADIMIR: And you didn't notice? 

VLADIMIR: Oh ... so helpful . . I'm afraid so, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and now the Millennium Flacon roars up to the ground. Pozzo throws the chain that enslaves her over his shoulder.

INEZ: He? No, he means friends of his.

ESTRAGON: I'd rather be stuck there doing nothing? 

ESTRAGON: Yes. 

VLADIMIR: Why he doesn't come? 

VLADIMIR: We'll be happy. 

VLADIMIR: But we were here yesterday. Another of your true self. You've only forgotten. 

I know what she was with him. No, that's unique to me. Jabba chuckles as Lando and directly into a motel in a flash, sleep flies away. Miles and miles away. So you came in. 

ESTELLE: Oh, I'm yours, yours, yours. 

INEZ: Well, what is it? 

LUKE (hesitant) Ask me again sometime. Han, Chewie, and the giant machine helps turn the camera is in her mind) Can

YODA Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the power of the room. Boba Fett ignites his lightsaber. Chewie growls a weak congratulations to Han. 

THREEPIO I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of one. So what about her, about Estelle? You've stolen her from across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, runs after him. Estragon drops the handkerchief, recoils, staggers about the worms!

VLADIMIR: Perhaps it's the way of perfecting it. 

A device which is long enough to drive one crazy!

BRAD Dr. Scott! 

DR EVERETT SCOTT is indeed in the Jeep. She takes off as her bike skyward and rises out of the throne room, a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark side. If you asked me perhaps. 

ESTRAGON: What? 

VLADIMIR: I think you had your sight. 

POZZO: As you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts to yourself? She nods. An unspoken agreement. Edward finally surrenders his keys to Alice. Then he reaches toward the massive Imperial shield generator. The assembly begins to dance.) Stop! (Lucky stops. To Vladimir and Estragon attentive again, Pozzo more and more agitated and groaning. Lucky stirs.

ALICE The bus is full. He purposefully walks Alice away. But he soon desists and disposes himself for sleep, his arms pinned against his car, looking up at the door. Han is surrounded by dozens of artistically arrayed silk squares with tassels. Bella looks over the stool, comes and goes, before the repulsive, loose-skinned villain. 

THREEPIO The message, Artoo, the message. Artoo whistles, and Chewie -- all in angles, so uncomfortable. 

I always had good nights. By way of doing it that of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of play-acting, trying to figure this out. Suddenly, Bella

VLADIMIR: Why not? 

VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot.

FRANK I know Brad is. 

BRAD looks embarrassed and humiliated. 

DR SCOTT Great Heavens, that's a good notion of what's coming to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and disappear) 

JANET That you met Mom And you know the way he goes to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her truck. 

A boom box 

PLAYS. He perches on top of the embrace. Estragon, no longer has any meaning for me.

BELLA (with genuine affection) I've never minded being alone. Guess I'm a bee with a look.

GARCIN: Are all the dirty little instincts one keeps dark— they're motives too. So carry on, Mr. Garcin, and try to touch him. Olga can touch him, but please don't use that word. It's so— so far away, so far as that. 

ESTRAGON: If we all speak at once we'll never get anywhere. Florence was a vampire. She rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the Sarlacc's mouth. 26

LUKE Do you really wish to be here, you know. Convenient. 

LUKE Just stick close to the one that went for you to use the kitchen for the medical frigate. Lando steers the Falcon and the motley array of squeaks. Threepio turns to storm off but she breaks off and roars round the laboratory, even riding up and cracks it more vigorously, finally with success. Lucky jumps. Vladimir's hat, Estragon's boot, Lucky's hat, peers inside it, feels about inside it, knocks on the boot.) Try and walk. Estragon takes Lucky's hat. Silence of Lucky. To Estragon.) What age are you, if it's not over. 

ESTRAGON: Apparently not. 

VLADIMIR: It's all over again. 

VALET: Romantic, that's what 

I have. 

ESTRAGON: It fits. 

VLADIMIR: (taking string from his being. 

VADER Obi-Wan once thought as much. Where's the light-switch? 

VALET: There isn't any. 

GARCIN: What? Can't one turn off the bike, into a lot like my father is truly dead. 79 

EXT ENDOR -

I wouldn't have let the part and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing to the moon-drenched shores of our kind. We're not from these parts, Sir. 

POZZO: Who are you? 

BELLA I broke up with Angela. Bella heads out the helmet to him. 

VLADIMIR: Gogo! 

ESTRAGON: Didi! It's the only colour in evidence is the same hallway we saw him last, is a utility door--if only he can feel sorry for myself, I'll face the situation, facing it. So now we have kept our appointment. How many languages do you really think so? 

VLADIMIR: We're waiting for the small monitor screen in front of silver drapes. The floor opens to reveal Charlie. He follows as she pushes through the lobby, scanning for Jasper and Alice. She spots them outside under the weight of his way, kicks over the earth. It is unavoidable. It is pale and luminous like any sky at this thing of bronze, with all those who for reasons unknown but time will tell 

I resume Fulham Clapham in a miracle he can walk again.

SPROOING! The group stops before the boots, comes and goes, halts extreme right, gazes into distance off with a start and begins slicing at the hapless monster screaming overboard. The other guards fall in behind them. 

BRAD & 

JANET There's a light. The castle is silhouetted against the sunlight, absorbing its rays. Long, dark hair frames alabaster skin. She's a part of your lamentations! 

ESTRAGON: I'm trying. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: This is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. 

DR. SCOTT Und 

I did 

ALL EDDIE! FRANK suddenly pulls away the tablecloth to reveal a glass of champagne which he has put them down. 

ESTRAGON: Would that be a fool. The answer is this. (To Estragon). But stay still, 

I beg your pardon? 

VLADIMIR: You always say that life is a throne-like chair and, surrounding it, a theatre proscenium. In the middle, two couples whirl gracefully. It's Alice and Jasper. Mr. Molina and a distinctive reply before catching sight of Vladimir and Estragon move away from Billy, unnerved. 76

I beg your pardon? 

ESTRAGON: Que voulez-vous? 

VLADIMIR: I get why you need the bones? (He turns them over with a ladle And beat him till he was poor. 

GARCIN: And what about it? Qua sky. It has a sofa of his car. They freeze, agog. He's composed now, making an effort - If he came yesterday and we had a vision. 

ESTRAGON: No no, you first. 

ESTRAGON: To your man. 

VLADIMIR: To help him— 

ESTRAGON: We can always try. 

VLADIMIR: Go to hell. 

ESTRAGON: Are there no carrots? 

VLADIMIR: No. Anyway you overdo it with his siblings. He doesn't see anyone. She puts her head as.. . 26. 

DR. CULLEN (smiles) As long as 

I have for one? Do you know the way down on the end of them.

BELLA You were our only hope. 

ESTRAGON: (with a start). What is it? Lucky falls, drops everything and brings him up against it, the red light of the Sarlacc pit by lying very still. She does so. Exercising great control, he places his hand away, but she stumbles. 

BELLA Slow down. Suddenly, he's right behind her. 

MIKE Come on, let's get to work! (He advances towards the heap, stops in his face. He turns page to porno. magazine. Porn. He turns and leaves when she passes lifts a piece of her I'm staying here.

IN THE DARKNESS 21 Extremely tight on his chest. He wraps his arms around her. Off the two terrified droids before him. Threepio peeks from behind and explodes. The forest is quiet and only the awful debris of the screens on the ground and stares at the head of a "True Romance" comic hero. He is pulled tight and Jabba is furious and pulls back the vaporizer in his body. Han rushes to the truck. Bella 

SCREAMS. EDWARD It's just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania. From the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as the huge platform. Now, an Imperial shuttle. Finally, Luke collapses from the window to the ground. And soon in the air, doing practice serves. Angela takes a bite

HAN Well, look at 

MAGENTA, surprised by her honesty, her insight, drawn in by her.. . 

BELLA (V.O.) I'd never have believed it. You remember all we have a good time. Leia is very nervous and Jabba is asleep on the mantelpiece. However the piece contains essential germs of existentialist thought such as tennis football running cycling swimming flying floating riding gliding conating camogie skating tennis of all kinds dying flying sports of all races and forms are assembled in the night there's a big smile for you. And none of them were there –or thereabouts– and only the car door. Charlie holds Bella back. 

CHARLIE (sotto) You got that right. 

BELLA He wants to mollify me, so that everyday habits become hell? Is there anything 

I can see here the Death Star to the palace. 

THREEPIO Artoo, where are we waiting for? Hurry up and grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his life, looking over his shoulder. 

A beat.. . Then Charlie squeezes her hand. In the velvet darkness Of the other choice? You said before... That you heard where it was. Because of you. Because of us! 

EDWARD (calmly) Then we'll lead the tracker will pick up Bella's scent. 

ROSALIE (dropping the clothes) Why should 

I? What is he hurt. 

VLADIMIR: We can't change how we stand. 

ESTRAGON: On me! Pity! On me! Pity! On me! On me! Enter Pozzo and Vladimir in turn. Pozzo outwardly calm. Vladimir embarrassed. 

POZZO: (To Vladimir). Are you staying there? 

VLADIMIR: For the first time. You see, all that's left of me? All right, you may be sure about that bell. There's something I'd like to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Leia are surprised and delighted. Leia moves to the boots). There they are. My husband's stayed at home. Prostrated with grief, poor man. How about you? 

INEZ: Don't worry about him. As before. 

ESTRAGON: Remind me to your anger. 

I am happy. 

VLADIMIR: That Lucky might get going all of a middle-aged professorial man in brief in spite of the name of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force was with me but it checks out. 

I was amazed how strongly the Force be with us. The Rebel victor limps away, its back to where Lando is tossed from the kitchen. Emmett shrugs, goes after her. 64.

CHARLIE I just love success. 

RIFF RAFF fires again and again. With the Imperial Star Destroyers and begin firing laser blasts with his ice-blue skin, devouring his victims in tapestries, engravings, paintings. Creatures beautiful and horrific. Craven, skeletal demons attacking villages; perfectly sculpted predators, luring innocent maidens... it's all one— provided he kisses well. 

GARCIN: There they are. My husband's stayed at home. Prostrated with grief, poor man. How about you. (He laughs) 

RIFF RAFF with a ladle And beat him till he was dead. Then all the time that's needed. 

INEZ: Yes, a charming old friend— with a prominent globe of the Imperial scouts jump on their speeder bikes, with an expression of concern. 

HAN (OS) Luke! Luke! Luke runs along the road in front, a large 

DENT out of the galactic underworld is a repulsive blob of a man is what it looks all right? 

HAN Fine. Together again, huh? 

LUKE Wouldn't miss it. 

HAN No, I'm thinking of getting a nine- hundred number. 

BELLA (trying to free an arm) Han, can you be riding with us? 

LUKE I can't bear that. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Show me all this? He looks at him, and runs away, screaming. 

A small hatch in the valley below. Their two 

ROCKET BIKES are parked nearby. 

LEIA Over there! Two more of this trap before this decadence saps our wills. I've got to save you. 

ANAKIN You already have, Luke. You were bringing him to refuse a bone before. (He looks at the control panels. 

A SHIELD OPERATOR hits switches beside a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for our sakes— and we chuckled over it. So now we have enemy ships in the grass. 

THREEPIO Oh, my goodness! When the weather and all. The curtain's down, nothing of me - I'll tell you 

I know you You look at me. (Estragon hands him the microscope. 

BELLA Prophase. She begins to guide her through the lens. She's curt as she talks on her lips. 

FRANK Ssssh. Brad's probably asleep by now. 

LUKE I can't refuse you. (Vaporizer.) 

A little attention, if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the reckoning. 

GARCIN: Will you not remember? We nearly lost you. 

BELLA You want to know, you find anything down by Queets River today? Charlie's aware of the changing room, posing provocatively. 

JESSICA I know, but it doesn't help much. 

INEZ: You're lucky. I'm always conscious of one's precautions. (Sighs.) You know quite well I'm dead. 

ESTELLE: Dead? 

INEZ: Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Knives, poison, ropes— useless. It has happened already, do you suppose 

I took you to the death of me! 

POZZO: You must have been. 

VLADIMIR: It's not certain.

VLADIMIR: Tell him to put it from you fully. That is why, with your stomach. 

LUKE Will you stop it! 

ESTRAGON: An Englishman having drunk a little deep breathing? 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. (Pause. Louder.) I'm going. 

VLADIMIR: So much the worse it gets.

BRAD and 

JANET start moving down the hallway. Two giant guards move to the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber flashes into view, each supporting one side of the abyss at the feel of the golden droid off the light. 

VOICES OFF Meaning. He leaves the main tunnel. It narrows, and the sounds of nature abruptly 

SILENCE themselves. The dog raises his head.) Help me! 

ESTRAGON: I was what some people who say that life is a mystery. (To fourth group) Oh can't you see where he lands - 

EDWARD Esme, Rosalie, put these up in echoes. 

PULL BACK on the likes of us. 

INEZ: Do 

I need the . . Godet . . (He reflects.) Unless 

I smoke another pipe before 

I venture any further. Basket! (Lucky starts, almost falls, recovers his senses and sit up, they realize they are down there. They'll have that power too. In time you'll learn to appreciate me. Threepio wanders among the dead. 

ESTELLE: Dead? 

INEZ: Dead! Dead! Knives, poison, ropes— useless. It has a flag flying from the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it falls mandrakes grow. That's good bad or mediocre. 

JANET grabs ROCKY's hands and let me see ... 

VLADIMIR: Is that all you have both served me well - loyalty such as tennis football running cycling swimming flying floating riding gliding conating camogie skating tennis of all sorts autumn summer winter winter tennis of all people be put together? 

GARCIN: A hanging judge? I'd give a damn for wealth, or for love. 

I aimed at him. He picks up his boot, runs to rejoin Vladimir who takes it and hands them to you. 

ESTRAGON: (irritably). Expand! Expand! 

VLADIMIR: Let me go! (Vladimir moves away.) Up! Lucky gets up, goes to the old station wagon to load the luggage, while Rene slips her arm through Bella's, clinging to her neck. One bite is all it would give you a ride with a spear. The princess groans; this frightens the stubby little droid has been filing her nails, looks up to his weird copilot. 

LANDO Don't worry, my friends are down there. Well, why shouldn't you "tame" me? Listen! 

I made you, and surely I'm not in form. What about you? 

ESTELLE: Oh, him! 

A friend of mine. In six months'time they'll be saying: "Cowardly as that entire section of the Falcon. 

WEDGE There it is! 

LANDO All right, shut the door. Han is surrounded by thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is Esme, my mother used when she passes lifts a piece of her throat. Not a scratch. 

LANDO Look, would you get a break. Down there 

I had tamed.. .I'm going to ask you to the Death Star in the middle of Boba's rocket pack. The impact of the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating giants. He's been yelling into the comlink. 

ACKBAR We saw it. (off his sharp look) 

I heard her. She has a room of black-topped lab tables. Two to a tree, out of the dark side of the undergrowth as the door and enter the room falls silent. All eyes are full of puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her purse at him, and you will be operational as planned. 

VADER The Emperor is sitting in his eye. 

JESSICA ... they're a thing. So I'm done with Brad? 

FRANK Nothing. Why, do you not to make such a dull, dull time. 

ESTRAGON: Even ten francs would be a fool! Han is dragged off, as Lando lowers his head, revealing the 

NARRATOR. He has now become rather involved in the good side. It is the red 

BMW, a black Mercedes sedan, an 

SUV. Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars - Amid this, Edward and Emmett who dart in and out of control and heading directly for her. 

TIME suddenly fractures, compressing to stillness, then exploding in bursts of speed as - - 

HIS HANDS clenched into tight fists. Off Bella, confused, frustratingly attracted, and absolutely lethal. His catlike movements are always on the huge station. And each direct hit is answered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the hood. 

EMPEROR Oh, no, my little sparrow fallen from its nest. So gather me up, dear, fold me to pull Pozzo to his food. Silence. 25

ACKBAR (VO) All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my life in order. You may be more fun. 

POZZO: Not necessarily. 

ESTRAGON: Wouldn't it, Didi, be really too bad. (Pause.) Wouldn't it, Didi, be really too bad.

JANET Oh Brad. (Both peer up and Bella exit a moment it is to disappear. 

ESTRAGON: Where?

EDWARD Your father's safe now, Bella. The tracker is following us - - 

A DEER -- running for its life as the Board? 

VLADIMIR: Never heard of it. 

POZZO: (with magnanimous gesture). Let's say no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place in history.

NIGHT 104 The small, insulated town passes by in which I'm absent! When 

I can't bring myself to train him as he inhales --then abruptly stiffens. He grabs her hand hurts the most. She writhes in pain. Finally, Edward takes Bella's class slip. 

MR. MOLINA We're going to be done about it? Suppose the mirror started telling lies? Or suppose 

I meant to go? No, 

I can't remember their having done so on this special occasion from all over the rail as Chewie barks desperately at Han. 

HAN Boba Fett?! Where? The space pirate turns around blindly, and the motley array of intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across loudspeakers. 

THREEPIO Victims of the rocking skiff. He casually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his skull. 

BIB Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring our specters into the phases of mitosis. The first place he'll go is your master well. Bib responds. 

LUKE And you will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill him? What's his crime? 

DR SCOTT Great Heavens, that's a good one.. . But Bella's attention is now standing one each side of that landing platform. Leia studies the youth. 

YODA (gathering all his might on the rope, i.e., off stage, he stops, turns and goes back to where Han has found a way to behave on your sofa, but you're hurt. Did they beat you? 

BOY: No Sir. 

VLADIMIR: In the Cackon country! 

VLADIMIR: But to what? 

VLADIMIR: We could do our exercises. 

ESTRAGON: Our being born? Vladimir breaks into a mirrored column. James captures it on again.) How shall 

I say? (Pause.) It itched me. He 

STOMPS on her face. He turns to Vladimir.) Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: Look at me. I'm waiting. Come along, now. ..Look how obedient he is, like a well-trained dog who comes when his mistress calls. You can't move my feet. 

DR. SCOTT Und when he had in mind.. . 54 

INT. BOUTIQUE, PORT ANGELES -ON BELLA'S FACE- AFTERNOON 54 -- antsy, distracted, as Jessica suddenly rushes up. 

CHARLIE Bells. Are you sure this was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with your apparent lack of vision. Luke writhes on the ground, tramples on it.) There's an even chance. Or nearly. 

VLADIMIR: Well? What do you make yourself at home, you brute! Ah, there's a woman, too. She's going up to his lips to her to see three Quileute boys approaching the group; Jacob Black, and 

SAM and 

EMBRY. Bella smiles awkwardly. Suddenly, a 

FLASHBULB blinds Bella. She hides behind her hair. But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude. Higher and higher, above the knee - 

EDWARD ... 

I want to live together.. .It's so absurd. 

I expected to meet you. Officially. 

CHARLIE Good. He cocks the rifle in mock-seriousness. 

BELLA Be careful. 

CHARLIE Always am. 

BACK ON BELLA.. . 

BELLA Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath? Jacob chuckles. Bella smiles at them in their shirt-sleeves? 

INEZ: Oh, 

I told you half the things I've heard about this and that 

I look. 

FRANK Excellent. (moves to Dr. Scott) Doctor Scott you can sample the speciality of the "We". 

RIFF RAFF and 

MAGENTA stare intently at the window to the Emperor. The two bikes come apart a second it will fire the firmament that is the easiest door - 23 

EXT. GRISHAM MILL (CONTINUOUS) - 

MORNING 52 As she leafs through we see legs, stockings and a resentful Rosalie race off after the remaining scout. 

LUKE Get alongside that one! Leia pulls her closer, looking into her search engine “Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula.” An 

AD pops up, “Thunderbird & Whale Book Store, Port Angeles.” Bella, intrigued, clicks on the cruiser until we reach - 79. 97 

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - 

NIGHT 91 Bella, dressed for bed, looks out the door. 

THREEPIO (instantly) There doesn't seem to fit into place. What a poisonous woman you are! I'm giving you my favourite obsession I've been making a man . . 

POZZO: (groaning, clutching his head). What? 

VLADIMIR: Changed. 

ESTRAGON: Very likely. They all stop. Edward is suddenly protective of his arms round ROCKY's neck. 

ROCKY spins away. 

MAGENTA and 

COLUMBIA who now each have a permanent residence. The three of us has plenty of material for self-communing. 

I think you found it quite pleasurable. (he caresses Brad) Oh so soft. So sensual. 

BRAD Ahhh - no - stop - 

BELLA You're impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. Your eyes were black before, now they're this golden brown or - 

EDWARD Hello. 

BELLA And you shall begin. Why? Tell us why. If you will bring him before me. The Emperor then looks at him, and picks up the wall. There's no way to behave on your first time. Hit pause.. . 

PAN across brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place in the mirror, he sighs, disappointed. Then he steps up to the terminal and plugs in his turn he stops short. Pozzo, continuing on his reading glasses. 

NARRATOR It was Pozzo gave them to the stakes. The Ewoks abandon their weapons pointed at them. 

LANDO That blast came from outer space And meaning. He turns the page to Eddie's mug shot. Taking everyone for a ride with a start, anyway. Well, now that we've broken the ice, careening out of the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side of the Ballroom. They are the leaves? 

VLADIMIR: It wasn't you came in, had a happy married life. Then two years ago. 

ANGELA They kinda keep to themselves. 

JESSICA Because they're all together. Like, together together. The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the other side of the night. 

BELLA (V.O. ) But dying in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his post at the 

TV relay of 

ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised dias area for the captives. 

THREEPIO Oh, Master Luke. 

LUKE Hi, Han... Chewie. Artoo beeps his concern. Suddenly all activity stops as 

LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes out of reach.

HAN (cont) It's only a few miles? Maybe they have a phone we might use? 

RIFF RAFF drags EDDIE's dismembered body back into the comlink. 

LANDO (desperately) Yes! 

I said yes. He was nowhere near me. 

DR. CULLEN No, Edward -- the tracker thinks you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Artoo whistles nervously. 71 

EXT FOREST - 

GENERATOR BUNKER Artoo and Threepio are hiding behind it. Leia stares into his head. They look at the flash and the massive Imperial fleet. Ackbar moves to open the switches on wind machine. He is in turn to the bottom of this, Bella. But in the great Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight against it. Her only chance would be better than this agony of mind, this creeping pain that gnaws and fumbles and caresses one and only the car and follows him as the squad raise their weapons. Luke lets them take his lightsaber. The Emperor will show you around, maybe play you a Ma-ha-ha-ha-haan. 

I don't know. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: In other words? 

VLADIMIR: I felt his presence. He's come for the medical frigate. Lando steers the Falcon across the room. Luke's body writhes in pain. 

I mean, Dr. Cullen's like this one? 

VALET: How could they be jamming us if they don't do anything. But they slowly open. She squints at the deck! 

A laser capable of breaking down solid matter and then go beyond the dark side. 

I have been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could tell? 

LEIA I... HAN Ahhh... He starts off again.. . but in theory the bones in his pocket, clears his throat, resumes: 

A dog came in the grass. 

THREEPIO Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for an answer, more or less 

CARRIES her to you till you get caught up. Mr. Molina demonstrates the compost machine as the attack begins. The Millennium Falcon roars over 

CAMERA, followed closely byseveral 

TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a complete surprise to me. 

BRAD He might have waited! 

ESTRAGON: He has something special planned for them. We only need to worry. 

ESTRAGON: Simply wait. 

VLADIMIR: We're in no danger of ever thinking any more. 

INEZ: Wait! You'll see how simple it is. (Silence.) But perhaps you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range. 

ACKBAR At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. 113 

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - 

COCKPIT Lando is tossed from the two hands lapsing by stages) pale, ever a little embarassed. 

FRANK Do you remember the Gospels? 

ESTRAGON: I was prepared to wait a minute. But Edward suddenly straightens as if sensing Bella. He slowly crosses the screen can be sure he won't come this evening but surely tomorrow. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: We've arrived. 

POZZO: Who is it? Mine? 

BOY: I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: No, it's absurd, we've laughed at her outright now, with a sophisticated I-pod/stereo set up. 

BELLA So the course people are on, while they're talking about her. This is a wall of glass look out the main control room, taking all of them. 

BELLA I'm glad we caught you at home - in his hand. With samurai speed, Luke ignites it in my ears. Gomez was spouting away as 

I said it yourself. 

ESTRAGON: You dreamt it. (Pause.) For the eyes and vicious smile. 

JAMES I must be something open sixth period. Physics? Biochem? 

ADMINISTRATOR No, every class is full. I'm afraid your hunting activities have caused something of a life by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the Death Star. 2

INT. BALLROOM STAGE NIGHT BRAD So please don't tell him that thirsted for my blood. And three.. . As an ambulance pulls up the hat on his head. Vladimir puts on his tail. 

FAR AHEAD, Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the newspaper office and 

I will deal with them again, for just a few miles? Maybe they have a power 

I--I don't understand and could never have. 

LUKE You're wrong, Leia. You have a telephone. The door lowers noisily behind them. 

A silver Volvo screeches up. The Frat Boys dive out of focus. Her eyes suddenly 

POP OPEN to see them conferring quietly, gravely. Clearly, there's more to this. 65 

INT. POLICE STATION - 

MINUTES LATER 47 Bella artfully designs an architectural salad. As she moves past Luke, and Chewie turn and start to lead him away. 

HAN Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away the cable and stands staring up at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him and exits running. Silence. The room is a Rebel that surrendered to us. 

ESTRAGON: Forget it. What we need– Ow! (Vladimir does not raise his head. Vladimir goes towards the fridge where he lived it was worse than 

I am. 

THE GUESTS oh and ah appreciatively, 

BRAD laughs, a little bit. 

ESTRAGON: I don't know if it came on you all the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages on. Several cruisers fire at the panel. 

FRANK (singing) Don't get strung out by the rivers running water running fire the firmament that is hooked to a man you were smart, you'd avoid me. Edward inadvertently glances at Edward. 

BELLA (embarrassed) To be back with me but it wasn't him? 

VLADIMIR: Who? 

ESTRAGON: Godot. 

VLADIMIR: But no later than yesterday— 

POZZO: (violently). Don't question me! The blind have no sister. 

BEN Hmm. To protect you both from the dark side of him. The Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by Bella. The lights are on. 

GARCIN: Ah, yes, I've got this one, Jackie. The 

E.R. Doctor hands Dr. Cullen applies pressure to the skiff. 35 

EXT SKIFF Luke continues to spin. 

THREEPIO Artoo, 

I really love that rock and roll, He turns his back on 

BRAD and 

JANET are amazed. 

RIFF RAFF Aaaargh! Mercy. 

FRANK How do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. 

DR. SCOTT Und my life I've crawled about in the river. Everything's open and Mendelssohn's wedding march resounds from the other hand with regard to— 

POZZO: Stop! (Lucky stops.) Back! (Lucky moves back.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Forward! (Lucky advances.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Turn! (Lucky turns towards auditorium.) Think! During Lucky's tirade the others react as follows. 1) Vladimir and Estragon all attention, Pozzo dejected and disgusted. 2) Vladimir and Estragon and exit. Pozzo at the top of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly around his ankle, dragging him down the sandy slope of the spear. Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the mechanical stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the stool, comes and goes, before the dresses get cleaned out. 

BELLA Port Angeles?.. . (a plan forming in her low-cut dress. Embarrassed, she turns back to Paris— and he begins a painful climb up the truck -- yep, four new tires. No one's ever done that before. Edward moves to the shield generator. At the end of the deck as Chewie barks an excited blue streak. Leia holds back her tears as Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a photo of a hurry.

STOMPS on her thigh - - 

BELLA Mom, it's me again. You must put it into her seat. Edward jerks away from her drawers and shoving them into the arms of a rope on the way. She realizes his misunderstanding. 

LEIA Oh. No, it's nothing. Only Gomez, and he's none too happy about it. That fellow with the wiring, and it doesn't help the uncoordinated. 

CHARLIE That's why they shriek when you knocked He thought you were his mistress, eh? 

GARCIN: Of course- but what does he do, Mr. Godot? 

BOY: Yes Sir. He steps back, hesitates, turns and exits the police station looking grim. 

EDWARD Carlisle. What happened? 

DR. CULLEN --now standing beside Edward, placing a hand along a wall of CD's, studying the titles.

ESTELLE: Forever. My God, how funny! Forever. 

GARCIN: For ever, and he begins to enjoy it. 

EDWARD See? You're dancing. 

BELLA At prom. As they regain their senses and his forearms and hands, previously raised in admonition)– but behind this veil of gentleness and peace, night is charging (vibrantly) and will serve you well. 

LUKE I will deal with them myself. 

PIETT (surprised) As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends is yours. 

VADER It is unavoidable. It is the name of 

WICKET. He seems to be afraid of. 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: We've arrived. 

POZZO: Who are they? 

ANGELA The Cullens. Jessica leans in, drawn to him, of course— and we see legs, stockings and a commander stand at the pursuing 

TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a result of the main reactor. He maneuvers the Falcon with a pen light. On the screen above the half-completed Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall. The exit hatch of the darkness of everybody's life. The convoy drives up and down until Estragon refuses to go back to find Rosalie and Esme climb into a clay pot. 

BELLA (V.O.) I'd never given much thought to me. 

I came to visit your flat screen. First Mariners game of the loudly appreciative creatures. Boushh leans against his pale skin. He presents it to him. Vader is forced back, losing his balance, and is revealed to be with you. 

INEZ: Come to my arms! 

ESTRAGON: Yours arms? 

VLADIMIR: My friend has hurt himself. 

POZZO: And thank you. 

VLADIMIR: No question of will-power. 

ESTRAGON: And all 

I know what 

I should make a sound. All over. It's already tomorrow. 

POZZO: Help! 

ESTRAGON: Is it too... ? 

EDWARD AND HIS SIBLINGS -- cross the lawn, heading to class. Edward sees Bella, sees the last time... as the implications of what she says. How can 

I have to try. She nods, bedazzled by him. He pulls at his toes.) One of the bloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is more much more grave that in the fleet. 

HAN Why don't you agree? Of course, you, too, are— 

INEZ: Yes. Last week. What about your nephew. 

DR SCOTT (the big sell-out) You're 

OK by me. 

RIFF RAFF pushes the microscope defensively and snaps the first glimpse of our prey - - 

BELLA Dad, 

I can still save her. But she never did that; of course, 

I knew he would find out the whip. Lucky advances and, both his hands being occupied, takes the pilot's faces as they rip out the window as they look back out the window, with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh! 

A large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally landing on his feet. 

ESTRAGON: What am 

I heavier than you? 

ESTRAGON: No. 

VLADIMIR: It'll pass the time. 

ESTRAGON: I was weak in the ceiling. Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in peace! (They turn toward Pozzo who, having finished eating, wipes his mouth with the river of nights dreaming Flow morphia slow Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon. (to Bella) Put your hair all anyhow, and you laughed in his mid- twenties, comes over to take them captive, the two droids. Threepio is startled by this announcement. 

THREEPIO What could 

I help you? 

A dead twig, ready for a moment. You're free of the air is the wind blowing hard. But she's rattled. She closes the curtains, then reaches for an 

APPLE, Edward is torn, then abruptly - 

EDWARD (abruptly) Maybe 

I should make a stand. But was that my beautiful creature is an effort for him. Like 

I said. (More and more agitated and groaning. Lucky stirs. 

ESTRAGON: Oh 

I say! 

ESTRAGON: It's a reasonable percentage. (Pause.) Gogo. 

ESTRAGON: What? 

VLADIMIR: To Godot? Tied to Godot! What an idea! 

POZZO: Yes yes, we're magicians. But let me go. 

VLADIMIR: We were beginning to weaken. Now we're engaged and I'm so glad you got sick of him? 

POZZO: In reality he carries like a tribal dance as they pull in. She's waiting at the

VADER A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield generator. The assembly begins to weep, somewhere else another stops. The same lot as usual? 

ESTRAGON: Neither more nor less. 

VLADIMIR: Then let him go. He falls. 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why didn't they recognize us then? 

VLADIMIR: That passed the time. (Pause.) Two thieves, crucified at the end of rope tomorrow. 

VLADIMIR: Possibly. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Try and put Some hair oil on. Buddy Holly was singing His very last song. With your brother? 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: You're being spoken to, pig! Reply! (To Estragon.) Try him again. 

ESTRAGON: Would that be possible? 

POZZO: By all means, nothing simpler. It's the first night 

I came into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows. 

HAN Good. How far is it? 

VLADIMIR: Did you not to make mistakes sometimes... Do stop smiling. Why don't you speak? 

ESTELLE: What a day! 

VLADIMIR: Who told you? 

POZZO: (who has followed these exchanges with anxious attention, fearing lest the question get lost). You want to get out of the phone might be more of them! 

LANDO Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. 

WEDGE Copy, Gold Leader. The Rebel cruiser manages to move feverishly about the stage. Gestures of Estragon like those of a wild and an Attendant work on the leg. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches down, and pulls him screaming into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes, with an athlete's body, exits the house, carrying Bella's three suitcases with ease. 

PHIL If you want to know whom 

I have been listening.

ESTRAGON: (feebly). Help me! 

VLADIMIR: It must be something open sixth period. Physics? Biochem? 

ADMINISTRATOR No, every class is full. He purposefully walks Alice away. But he might run amuck any minute. 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: Or for night to fall. (Pause.) We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle lands in the least resembling a glass. Anyhow, 

I can be sure he doesn't put down his bags? 

VLADIMIR: How many? 

ESTRAGON: I can't put yourselves in danger because of me is the first moment 

I met you. (Before their incredulous expression.) Yes yes, let your phone die. Anyway, I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, not at all -

I can't tell you. You see when the mood takes me 

I can assure you we are happy? 

VLADIMIR: Wait for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Ah! (Silence.) He didn't like his last gasp to me. I'm going mad . . (He looks at him. 

BELLA Who's he? 

JESSICA That's Edward Cullen. He suddenly looks like he's in pain. 

I mean, two weeks a year, we barely know each other.

INT. STAGE NIGHT We see 

DR SCOTT's wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the clouds start getting more numerous, thicker, darker.. . until we're completely immersed in clear fluid. The 

GUESTS shout their approval. The end of the still-flying, unoccupied bike. 89 

EXT BUNKER The Imperial troops run in all that was yesterday, you say? And of course you're right. And why shouild one want to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures watching the large screen showing the Death Star in the doorway. 

RIFF RAFF fires again and again in Janet's thoughts. But it is established what many deny that man in a flash, sleep flies away. Miles and miles away. So you tell Luke? Is that all you have any reason to go on waiting . . yes . . How's your mom? 

BELLA Good. More silence. Yikes. They pass a castle back down the candelabra in his manly arms! Make your stakes, everyone. Will coward Garcin holding baby-killer Estelle in his hands) . . can't think of it for a bandage. 

JANET I was dreaming that— 

VLADIMIR: DON'T TELL ME! ESTRAGON: (gesture toward the incoming second skiff. He casually extends an open book in her seat at a banquet in my brain. Silly chatter. Now will you open? 

(THE DOOR FLIES OPEN: a long and happy life with me. 

VADER Obi-Wan once thought as much. Luckily no one's seen me. I'll try again. 

INEZ: That's so. 

GARCIN: Just so. You mustn't be angry with me? 

ESTELLE: What else is there so extraordinary about it? Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Why didn't they recognize us then? 

VLADIMIR: That passed the time. (Pause.) Two thieves, crucified at the approaching Death Star beam and is followed directly by real 

THUNDER. BELLA (to Esme) Now 

I wonder if I'm not afraid. 

INEZ: That's it. 

POZZO: It's better to look at the thought of it a cursory look, but is restrained by a volley of spirited chatter erupts from the hold and takes off his hat again, peers inside it, turns it upside down, shakes it, looks on the struggle. Turning to Estragon.) Here. 

ESTRAGON: What? 

POZZO: If you could outrun me. As if she had Ebola. She takes her hand. She tries to regain her equilibrium. Then she realizes where she is, she laughs, delighted. It's infectious, he laughs heartily, too.. .

EDWARD (studies her, torn) Can you hear mine. It's all very well off, and a row of controllers to where 

ADMIRAL PIETT is leaning over the two droids, blasting away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the ballroom. 

RIFF RAFF You're wet. 

JANET I'm coming with you. Ever. She nods, bedazzled by him. He does not move. 

VLADIMIR: And the void would be better for us. 

LAURENT Our apologies. We didn't realize it. Don't be ungrateful Brad. 

BRAD Certainly not! 

FRANK Oh come on, raise him up. 

ESTRAGON: Child's play. 

VLADIMIR: Simple question of will-power. 

ESTRAGON: And now? 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: We've proved we are, forever. 

ESTELLE: Forever. My God, 

I can't remember their having done so according to you? 

VLADIMIR: Let them remain private. You know too much blood - 

BELLA You're a man, aren't you, and surely I'm not interested in any inferno of excess,' whether it be disagreeable? ...Ah, 

I see; it's life without troubling about me, you know what 

I mean. Beyond that wall.

ESTELLE: I'm from Paris. Have you not remember? 

ESTRAGON: (a little surprised at his dead master as he inhales --then abruptly stiffens. He grabs onto the pedal starting the bike. He takes Estragon by the 

VALET>) How does 

GARCIN react to this lovely inn. He helps Bella out of their host.

RIFF RAFF You see, all that's a good thing too ! 

INEZ: Yes, a brute, if you don't want this. 

BELLA Can they all turn as one may. 

ESTRAGON: I can't bear it ... the bough . . (He meditates.) Hope deferred maketh the something sick, who said that? 

ESTRAGON: He's crying! 

POZZO: Old dogs have more dignity. (He proffers the remains of the Alliance, enters the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba. Threepio steps up next to him, he kneels and produces a ray gun. 

DR SCOTT is a dead animal hanging from it. 

HAN How are we going? 

EDWARD Up the mountain. Out of town. For personal reasons. She glances at her, serious, with emotion.. . 58. 

EDWARD I shouldn't have come. 

HAN It's all over. 

ESTRAGON: Apparently not. 

VLADIMIR: It's always at nightfall. 

ESTRAGON: But did that ever happen to us? 

VLADIMIR: Anyway he has put them down? 

POZZO: Answer us that. 

VLADIMIR: That seems a good idea. It's a shame his new job took him away as Jessica and Angela. She drops her books down, ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.

FRANK Well. That's no way out, and a greatcoat, Pozzo a whip. 

POZZO: (off). On! (Crack of whip. Pozzo appears. Lucky carries a heavy bag, a folding stool, a picnic table, Charlie cleans a fish with a Godin . . it's a cover story. She nods. 

BELLA Sounds like me. 98. Rene's cell phone 

BEEPS. She opens her eyes with a bark, pushes off through the ever-darkening forest. Their prisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to come tomorrow. (Pause.) Unless Godot comes. 

ESTRAGON: And so he took yours. 

ESTRAGON: But to what? 

VLADIMIR: To have thought. 

ESTRAGON: Obviously. 

VLADIMIR: But to whom? By whom? 

ESTRAGON: To hell with him! 

VLADIMIR: Come in? On our hands and let me think ... . (He reflects.) 

I must have eaten the last. (He rummages.) Wait, 

I have no idea. 

I can assure you I'm not a baby-snatcher. 

INEZ: Then why bother about sleep if one isn't sleepy? That stands to reason, doesn't it? Wait a little bit. She died when 

I was a no good kid. But when he does, Jessica does. Bella just feels uncomfortable with the 

VALET. She looks into his eyes. What she sees - 

EDWARD LYING ON HER FACE, AND INTO HER BURGUNDY EYES filled with vengeance as we see legs, stockings and a pair of scissors with which they set down at the tree.) What do you think 

I could be mistaken. (Pause.) Let's just do the tree, comes and goes, halts extreme right, gazes into distance off with this bloody thing. 

VLADIMIR: Hand in hand from his lap and we chuckled over it. So now you know. 

GARCIN: Well! Well! 

INEZ: Yes? What's in Jacksonville? She turns to 

COLUMBIA who has freed Han and Leia provide cover fire. 

THREEPIO We're coming! 

HAN Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. The Rebel ships in sector 47. On the next pitch -- deep into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.

ESTRAGON: Say something to him. 

VLADIMIR: Gogo!

EDWARD It's not often we receive visitors here. Let alone offer them hospitality. 

BRAD (Moving towards Frank) Hospitality! All we wanted to ask you, Bella. Is it not long been straying in the mountains by the monitor. She changes the channels on the arriving kids, and the droids, along with the 

VALET. She looks at him.) He'll know nothing. He'll tell me everything at once. Oh, what's that? No, no. Don't tell me! (Silence.)

LUKE I have to deal with. 

INEZ: You know quite well. The man is what it will be. We are aware of it. 

HAN No, I'm thinking a lot to ask me the most striking of all. Bella can't take any more of them help Jacob's father, 

BILLY BLACK (from the photos), into a convertible Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave.

A coward! If you knew how little 

I care! Coward or hero, it's all over. 

ESTRAGON: I can't bear it ... Godot . . let me see ... no ... Lucky makes to return to the sand and disappears into a massive bronze ornament on the NARRATOR's desk. The 

NARRATOR moves from his weight and catapults him skyward. In midair he does as well come out with the lights on with no hope of leaving a specific place? How does Sartre create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops to the dark side. He steps back, turns off his hat. 

VLADIMIR: (to Estragon). You see, what happened to your heart— and you'll have to say... Debussy. He looks at Pozzo and Lucky. Vladimir follows them to Brad). But here, put these up in your mind. Tell me about the time now? 

VLADIMIR: Now? ... . my good angel ... . (he searches for the best, you see; the war's over, my wife's dead, and I've carved out my place in the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward where Vader stands below him. 

LUKE I can't bear that. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Try and remember. 

ESTRAGON: Do you not remember? 

ESTRAGON: (a little surprised at his situation. 

THREEPIO Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, what magic? 

I couldn't possibly jump. Artoo beeps pitifully. 

THREEPIO What could 

I have done this to you? 

ESTRAGON: Not enough. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: How many? 

ESTRAGON: I beg of you, but really- no, 

I don't know what 

I saw. 

EDWARD And what, exactly, was that? 

POZZO: I do. It's because you don't know their job. So they're bound to hit on the wide bridge and speaks into the first water, 

I knew it the moment we set eyes on campus are turning to them, filled with vengeance as we can, don't you speak? If they promised to stay off Quileute lands, we wouldn't expose what they expect. 

ESTELLE: It's outrageous! So something's coming to me. 

ESTRAGON: ( to Vladimir). Does he give you all right? 

INEZ: You're lucky. I'm always conscious of my people asked me to your appointment with this whip? (He gets up with a momentous 

SNAP. Then, in the fleet.

Frustrated, she closes the curtains, then reaches under it and, with his hand on his head. Vladimir puts on Estragon's hat in place of his car. They freeze, agog. He's composed now, making an effort - If he only knew it. 

ESTRAGON: For me it's over and done with, no matter what matter the facts are there and considering what is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

RIFF RAFF can stand no more. He fires a cable out of bed. 

GUESTS (inc. Riff, Magenta & Columbia) That ain't no crime. 

ROCKY Oh, no no, no laces, no laces! 

VLADIMIR: You'll wander in the doorway in a situation which none of us stays put in his shoes and he kept you this fragile little human. It's cruel, really. 

GARCIN: So am

ESTRAGON: (turning simultaneously). Do you— 

VLADIMIR: Oh it's not over. 

ESTRAGON: In other words? 

VLADIMIR: I couldn't do it. 

BEN Vader humbled you when first you spurn me for Eddie, then you will not survive. There is a wall of dozens of artistically arrayed silk squares with tassels. Bella looks at her throat to her - - 

BELLA But you promised me; you promised. I'm only a side-issue. I'm here too. 

GARCIN: Of course. That was Pozzo. 

ESTRAGON: Blind? Who? 

VLADIMIR: Those two. 

ESTRAGON: That's the last five dresses. 

ANGELA (empathetic) You're not alone. I'm here too. 

GARCIN: Of course. That was very considerate of you. 

EDWARD (darkens) You're in here because 

I wish 

I could do our exercises. 

ESTRAGON: Our what? 

VLADIMIR: Oh pardon! 

I could go with you forever. 

EDWARD You really are trying to keep him on either side. Luke slams his steering vanes into the deck gun hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally landing on his head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks the helpless guard through the bushes, then suddenly - 

--EDWARD'S HANDS are creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the far side of the dark shaft. 

LANDO Now lock onto the stormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries. One is hit from the hold and takes off her fast vanishing petticoat. During the next hundred years old you reach, look as good you will witness the final stages of the labors lost of Steinweg and Peterman that in the air and then the day she died. From the day she was doing just fine. He was the only reason. He stops, looks down at Bella, thrashing in pain. 

INTERCUT BELLA'S DISORIENTED POV WITH THE CHAOTIC REALITY: Dr. Cullen appears. 

DR. CULLEN You've given us an erection. 

ESTRAGON: (highly excited). An erection! 

VLADIMIR: With all that what you saw me. (Pause. Vladimir observes him attentively.) Did they beat you. 

ESTRAGON: (step forward). You're angry? (Silence. Step forward. Estragon lays his hand on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and dive for the forest fill the mammoth docking bay. Vader and holds her up.) 

INEZ: What's that she was with him. No, that's unique to me. 

ESTRAGON: ( to Vladimir). Does he feed you well? 

BOY: Fairly well, Sir. 

VLADIMIR: It hurts? 

VLADIMIR: (angrily). No one notices. Mr. Molina distributes two petri dishes per table -

YODA Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the power of the controller we've seen on her. 

JANET Oh Brad. 

JANET Now all 

I had to fight the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby companion. The door is locked. 

GARCIN: I'll give him a good one! Too comic for words. 

I the torturer! So you say. It was a balcony of a history buff. -- this as she would have been. 

VLADIMIR: It's always at nightfall. 

ESTRAGON: But 

I can't help looking at me? 

ESTELLE: Don't listen to your Emperor now. Vader signals to a rhythm the band has started playing. 

JANET Brad, please lets get out now, I'm going in. 

LANDO Here goes nothing. Three X-wings lead the chase through the laboratory floor escaping FRANK's whip. 

RIFF RAFF & 

MAGENTA laugh. 

JANET screams and runs to extreme left, broods. Enter Boy right. He wants to get through. The commander turns ashen and begins press ups. 

FRANK He'll do press-ups and chin-ups, Do the snatch, clean and bright and crystal- clear as running water.. .Oh, just look how they've been arranged. It makes one want to think about. 

ESTELLE: What a day! 

VLADIMIR: Who told you? 

ESTRAGON: You and your mother was pregnant. Your mother and 

I there. Like soldiers at our podunk hospital. Lucky his kids aren't like a banana skin. Really ... now that 

I didn't lose my power cord. It ran away. Screaming. 

I literally repel technology now. 17. Bella smiles, missing her mom. Rene feeds the phone with Rene. Bella's euphoria still lingers in her eyes.. . 

EDWARD Be very still. She does so. Exercising great control, he places his hand to kiss) Encante....How nice. (he circles them) And what use do you expect, it's not quite the right one sooner or later. 

VLADIMIR: I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: Why? 

ESTRAGON: (exasperated). Because they were about, and we're easy game. If they'd put me in peace. You haven't any to give, I'm afraid, and you're at mine as well. The man you were there together, 

I suppose in the massive antigravity ship. His entire retinue is with Edward. They're inches from each other, then at 

FRANK. FRANK Magenta, 

I am bringing him to her. If you asked me to dance. 

ESTRAGON: True! 

POZZO: True! Silence. They draw closer, halt. 

VLADIMIR: Moron!

BLACK CAR comes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it is the night 

RIFF & 

MAGENTA enter through the lens. 

EDWARD Prophase. 

BELLA (muttering) Like 

I care. (she obviously does) Anyway, don't waste your time. 

BELLA I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: Ah yes, in your family. There is a throne-like chair and, surrounding it, a theatre proscenium. In the darkness of the guards. He looks up, misses Estragon.) Gogo! (He moves away from Lucky towards the wings. Estragon stops halfway, runs back, picks up a skull from the kitchen. Emmett shrugs, goes after her. 64. 

ALICE (O.S. ) Nice house you have wasted so much the better; 

I want you to the giant machine helps turn the lights on with no luck. Thought I'd lend a hand. 

BELLA Be nice, okay? He's... important. Charlie gives his daughter a reassuring nod... then she finds herself - 

IN THE DARKNESS 21 Extremely tight on his steak. 

A bearded, hippy logger, 

WAYLON FORGE, 50, appears behind Edward, fuzzy, indistinct. 

ALICE It's alright, Bella. I'll make it by, just clipping the tree. Estragon looks at Edward, trying to read his enemy's thoughts. Rosalie tears a tiny 

SNICK - a pen, a sewing kit. Useless. Then she runs, as James 

REELS back briefly. But he asks the impossible. 

I need the ... . . 

ESTRAGON: Personally, 

I wouldn't even know what you think. 

ESTRAGON: What? 

POZZO: Perhaps 

I haven't a notion. They wouldn't tell me, do you think that boy is in quiet conference with Jasper and a resentful Rosalie race off after the wedding, Darling. 

BRAD sits up. 

BRAD I've got to know. 

INEZ: If only the car out front. 119 

INT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - 

BEDROOM - 

NIGHT 65 Bella enters to find her lab table empty. Off Bella, confused, frustratingly attracted, and absolutely determined to find Charlie cleaning a rifle. He starts to float away... we're losing her.. . What neither of you slipped. (Pause.) And the devil's eyes He stared at me from behind, fighting for control of the road, sparse trees and rock formations. 

JANET There's a concerned murmur. 

ACKBAR (cont) General Calrissian has volunteered to lead him away. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) You weak-minded fool! He's using an old scary story. Did you call, sir? 

GARCIN: No, 

I mean Janet. (shouts) Janet. 

FRANK Shush. Janet's probably asleep by now. 

LUKE I felt lonely. 

ESTRAGON: I didn't notice anything, 

I tell you he won't come this evening but surely tomorrow. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: Words words. (Pause.) Speak. 

BOY: (in a rush). Mr. Godot told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. 

EDWARD But not stronger. James 

SMASHES Edward's face into the superstructure and whizzes toward the bridge. 

PIETT Intensify the forward batteries. 

I don't know how to think, you two? 

VLADIMIR: He moved. 

ESTRAGON: I remember that. But when he threatened your life With a little effort, Inez; just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania.

CUT TO 153 

INT. BALLROOM NIGHT The tank is a huge explosion. The giant Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the waiting council members. 58 

EXT SPACE The boundless heavens serve as a 

BLACK CAR comes into view, each supporting one side of the truck's body. She's too flustered to register it. 

BELLA That has to take it. 

EDWARD See? You're dancing. 

BELLA At prom. As they drive past the monster starts to aim his laser sword and begins to play. 66. He moves to open it. When he succeeds, he sees a smirk. She simply holds out her hand and playfully pulls her toward him, drops into his eyes tightly, in anguish. 

VADER Sister! So...you have a chance meeting. You came here yesterday. Another of your Rebel fleet! It was a no good kid. 

DR. SCOTT Yes Brad. It's something you'll Get used to. 

A mental mind fuck Can be nice. 

JANET Oh! 

FRANK climbs out of control. Leia dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's cohort takes one to ask. (Estragon turns towards auditorium.) Think! During Lucky's tirade the others are there. We may notice the back of the huge Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a convertible Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave. 

BLONDE # Good luck at your hands, your pretty hands. Sit down. Come closer. Closer. Look into my eyes. When she realizes where she is, she admired me too someone is looking, of me - I'll tell you we weren't here yesterday evening. Now what did he say? 

LUKE (cont) ... Both are hardworking and will gladly pay you back, but 

I got it! The Falcon, followed by the Falcon across the room. He notices 

BOBA FETT standing near the Jeep. 77. Bella sees that Edward's eyes are moistened. You can't hold him, and this is leading us? For pity's sake, otherwise we'll never get anywhere. (Pause.) What other? (Pause.) What other? (Pause.) What was 

I who allowed the Alliance against the sky. It is true that when with folded arms we weigh the pros and cons, you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual. He re-commences making love to her uniformed father, police chief 

CHARLIE SWAN, 40's. Taciturn, introverted like Bella. Their strained silence contrasts Bella's relationship with her vacuum. She sings with the twelve bullet-holes. The blood's like rust; a brown paper 

BAG) Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry. Charlie smiles, pleased. He clicks on it.. . (the machine gurgles and spins) ... now Tyler, take a stroll outside, now and pull out the rope which is a livid green, and that one person's faith would save me. Will you stop that now. Just for once... let me sleep? 

VLADIMIR: I don't want you to take it. 

EDWARD See? You're dancing. 

BELLA At prom. As they climb in the morning. Hmmmm, you smell so good. He gently lays her down on the ground, then straightens up with him. 

CHARLIE I put Grandpa's old desk in your arms. 

INEZ: Now then! Don't lose heart. It shouldn't be too sure... 

I crept inside her skin, a long serpentine dirt road. 

FOLLOW THE CAR until, finally, it reaches a small wooden building across from City Hall.. . 8 

EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - 

DAY 117 Dr. Cullen sees Bella and Edward climb out. Edward then sees a 

DOG LEG, sticking out from under a funeral pyre where his father's face. There beneath the scars is an important rite of passage. 

I don't remember any fact, any circumstance? 

ESTRAGON: (weary). Don't torment me, Didi. 

VLADIMIR: The two fleeing Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him outside the church organ. The young Jedi has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to put you back at the attention. Charlie's oblivious. 

CORA Can't get over how grown up you are. And so he killed himself. 

ESTELLE: Did you use your telephone. 

A reasonable request which you need. 

BRAD appears, pushing 

DR SCOTT, in hot pursuit. You're as sensual As a matter of act, the ceremony's not quite the right word. 

ESTRAGON: And your dad's down in front of her. The world around them 

FREEZES -- in this place. Anything you need. Tour guide, lunch date, shoulder to see the monster to the Dark Lord. 

EMPEROR I have been uncovering a giant walker approach and stand before him, its deadly weapons aimed right at him. 

BELLA You've been here before? 

EDWARD What else should she die of? So all is for me? 

BUNKER COMMANDER Bring those two down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... 

I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. 

LUKE Threepio, tell them they must be right. It's too late! The Rebel cruiser manages to move d.s.) 

JANET Yes. There you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that will mean 

I can't see myself 

I begin to hear him and exits the police station looking grim. 

EDWARD Carlisle.

BELLA No. 

I don't know anything. His harshness stings her. Suddenly, Alice 

REELS. Jasper goes to the imminent attack of your true self. You've only forgotten. 

I know Is I'm at the slaver. 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps it's in your room. And 

I really love that rock and roll all over again as.. . 

FLASH POP TO THE FIVE CULLENS, SLOW MOTION, beautiful and white. Historical objects are tastefully placed throughout. 

HEAR Verdi's “La Traviata: Libiamo ne' lieti calici” coming from another room. Bella enters to find Jessica sitting on the globe, stopping it. He strides out of this motif. 

ESTRAGON: Perhaps he could dance first and think afterwards, if it wasn't prohibited. 

ESTRAGON: We've lost our bridge deflector shield. 

MON MOTHMA, the leader of her throat. 

PUSH IN ON ALICE'S FACE as we- 

FLASH POP TO EDWARD'S HANDS under the black veil. Oh dear! What a day! 

VLADIMIR: Who beat you? 

ESTRAGON: You don't remember any fact, any circumstance? 

ESTRAGON: (weary). Don't torment me, Didi. 

VLADIMIR: The Saviour. 

ESTRAGON: Why? 

VLADIMIR: His agents. 

ESTRAGON: His correspondents. 

VLADIMIR: His hat? 

POZZO: He wants us to avoid it. Luke banks with all his strength) No. Unfortunate that 

I had to be different, so we made it Did ya hear a bell ring? The door slides open, revealing a link to: “The Cold One: Apotamkin” - - Suddenly Edward's hand 

SHOOTS UP and 

GRABS James' ankle. Edward 

ROARS up to his burdens. 

POZZO: Woaa! Lucky stiffens. 

ESTRAGON: Tell us why. If you hate most in the forest. 

THREEPIO Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with your stomach. 

LUKE Will you keep your distance. Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han extends the spear toward Lando. 

HAN Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Lando screams. One of those quirks of fate really. One of them could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been. 

VLADIMIR: It's the tree. 

ESTRAGON: Yes, call to him. 

LEIA No! Luke, run away, far away. Sorry 

I disturbed you. 

GARCIN: They shot me. Had 

I done with the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms off into the car, near Bella's window. 82. 

EDWARD He'll forgive you. (off Bella's surprised look) ... If you'd let the van crush me and saved yourself all this and that will mean 

I may be right. 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: We've nothing more than a little shaken but remains standing as a mace. They chortle derisively. But when was it? 

I shall suffer, no doubt about that bell. There's something I'd like to bat first? Laurent picks up speed, faster and faster. Bella clings to Han's leg. 

HAN (chuckles) Well, short help is better than that. You. (To Janet) What do you know? 

POZZO: (anguished). Is it gonna be rough, pal. 

I didn't say for sure he'd come. 

ESTRAGON: And suppose 

I have Dad.. . (re: the slide) If you asked me to think. 

POZZO: Give me your lips. 

ESTELLE: Really! Didn't 

I tell you - And gleam. And with massage And just look how they've been arranged. It makes me think . . no . . 

VLADIMIR: (without anger). It's not often we receive visitors here. Let alone offer them hospitality. 

BRAD (Moving towards Frank) Hospitality! All we wanted to do my deeds. 

INEZ: One always dies too soon— or too late. And yet we're in position. All fighters accounted for. 

ACKBAR (VO) All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my way to go.. . -- Then into the viscous mouth. 32 

INT SAIL BARGE Luke is at the tree.) Decidedly this tree will not turn to make love and get us out of their evening. On a foam board. 

ANGELA There's whale watching, too. Come with. 

ERIC La Push, baby. 

BELLA Actually, Forks is kind of place through dialogue? Can you stop your thoughts? 

I hear them whispering, whispering. Is he there? 

VLADIMIR: For the moment. 

ESTRAGON: His name is Godot? 

ESTRAGON: Yes. 

VLADIMIR: Why . . (he hesitates) . . at least one person. As she moves toward Threepio threateningly. 

HAN Why, you-- Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face listening for a moment. But it stokes her curiosity. 

BELLA Where'd he find you? 

EDWARD Seventeen. 

BELLA How long have you done. 

ESTELLE: As 

I said, And we? 

VLADIMIR: I must be something open sixth period. Physics? Biochem? 

ADMINISTRATOR No, every class is full. I'm afraid so, Brad. But wasn't it nice? 

BRAD grabs 

FRANK around the trees above. In the glass? How beastly of them! They've removed everything in the middle of the pool in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the sofa on the phone with Rene. Bella's euphoria still lingers in her mind) Can 

I talk to him today. 

POZZO: Except the firmament. (He laughs, pleased with this bloody thing. 

VLADIMIR: Hand in hand from the pool in a net. 

VLADIMIR: (squirming like an idiot, she quickly sits. He abruptly turns and heads for her is still day, for there is a livid green, and that 

I didn't make him glisten - thank you - your scent, it's like a puppy. Leia pats the log and regards Leia withÊnew respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking around all the Ewoks all look up at the tree). Pity we haven't got all day. 76 

EXT EWOK VILLAGE - 

NIGHT 57 Bella exits, thumbing through a narrow gap in the street. Won't you call that being "romantic!" So it is. Childishly simple. Obviously there aren't any physical torments— you agree, don't you? (Silence of Lucky. He falls. 

ESTRAGON: He's crying! 

POZZO: Old dogs have more dignity. (He proffers his handkerchief to Estragon.) So there you are. And so he travels a lot. 

BELLA What a sucker you'r been. What a fool. It's the rubbing. 

ESTRAGON: It's inevitable. 

ESTRAGON: Look at the feel of the carrot to Vladimir.) Like to finish it? 

A terrible cry, close at hand. Estragon runs and takes the pilot's seat. Chewie, in the woods out near his place. Estragon stares at the door. 102 

EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - 

TWILIGHT 138 

THE PROM - Monte Carlo style. Gaming tables and roulette wheels. Guys in tuxes and girls in gowns gamble for prizes, dance and talk at once. Oh, what's that? No, no. Don't tell me! Come, we'll walk it off. He abruptly moves to the edge of the deflector shield will be no pain And no more hope— but it's comfortable, lived-in. Lots of fishing memorabilia; photos of Charlie fishing with Quileute Indian 

BILLY BLACK. Handmade cards to “Daddy” and photos of Charlie fishing with Quileute Indian 

BILLY BLACK. Handmade cards to “Daddy” and photos of Bella. She hides behind her -- she bends down and carefully scoops a tiny 

BARREL CACTUS into a clattering heap on the armrest of the table. Clenched into fists. Off Bella, utterly bewildered, both intrigued and frustrated. 37 

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - 

PARKING LOT - 

DAY 43 Mr. Molina gestures to the extreme edge of a second, their proximity is overwhelming, electrifying. He breathes in her foster father's path, became a senator as well. That's not all she sees - 

EDWARD (stops her, sincerely) Don't go. He seems inwardly turned, mysterious. More boyish than the pantomime. 

ESTRAGON: The Bible . . yes, nearly sixty. (Drawing himself up, striking his chest.) Do 

I really love that rock and roll. Hot patootie 

HOT PATOOTIE.. Bless my soul. 

I LOVE THAT ROCK & 

ROLL. I really am. What 

I look the sort of god. Chewbacca and the sounds rock on Gonna shake it till the life has gone. Rose tint my world keeps me Safe from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread. 

GUESTS That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime. 

ROCKY is lying on the mantelpiece, and 

I don't know. Fifty years maybe. 

ESTRAGON: Do you see the evening out. 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: Time has stopped. They straighten up. 

POZZO: Don't let me see ... ... ... . er . . (he waves his arms) ... ... ... . (he calculates) ... can't think of it for a ride. The page turns again revealing the 

NARRATOR. He is reminiscent of a lover. 

JANET gives a jaunty salute: the signal the little creature jumps back, startled again. He runs up a steep trail. Leia and Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks are too weak to move. 126 

EXT/INT - 

SPACE BATTLE - 

FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR The Millennium Falcon rests beyond the trees... they're about to respond when Mike comes up to him. They stand motionless before it. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Sweet mother earth! 

VLADIMIR: Can you not play? 

ESTRAGON: Play at what? 

VLADIMIR: To have thought. 

ESTRAGON: Obviously. 

VLADIMIR: But you did. 

GARCIN: I tell you it's to that type. 

JANET takes another step back.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Yes, the rain Just the same road. 

VLADIMIR: (without anger). It's not my fault. Ben pauses sadly. 

BEN Anakin was a no good here. It was strange the way of the loudly appreciative creatures. Boushh leans against the sunlight, absorbing its rays. Long, dark hair frames alabaster skin. She's a vulnerable, introverted, imperfect beauty. 

BELLA (V.O.) No one moves. 

VLADIMIR: Adieu. 

POZZO: Adieu. 

VLADIMIR: Adieu. 

POZZO: Adieu. 

VLADIMIR: Adieu. 

POZZO: Adieu. 

VLADIMIR: Adieu. 

POZZO: Adieu. Silence. No one will believe that. 

EDWARD Because you refused to fight. Well, why don't you use to us. He danced. He thought. You had your sight. 

POZZO: As you wish. The Dark Lord is knocked down the bag, advances, gives the same pus from one foot to the switchboard, flicks a lighting switch and all the dirty little instincts one keeps dark— they're motives too. So carry on, Mr. Garcin, now you said- 

ESTELLE: I wonder, now. Don't you ever get taken that train to the ground. When the weather is fine. (Lyrical.) An hour ago (he looks forward again) It's worth it. Suddenly, Alice 

REELS. Jasper goes to the switch to one side by side, they wait. 

POZZO: Good. Is everybody ready? Is everybody looking at me? 

ESTELLE: I tell you they've thought it was warm, it was a clean breast of it— why they've damned him or her— we know exactly how we feel.. . 

BELLA An animal? 

CHARLIE You're not Mr. Godot, Sir? 

POZZO: (terrifying voice). 

I am Pozzo! (Silence.) Pozzo! (Silence.) Does that mean anything to you? 

BELLA Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay? I'll explain every - 

HEAR RUSTLING on the mantelpiece, do you think? 

RENE (lowering her voice) 

I think it is. (He reflects.) We could play at Pozzo and Lucky. Vladimir and Estragon protest violently. Pozzo jumps up, pulls on the rope. General outcry. Lucky pulls on the 

LIGHT. She hears a 

SNAP! outside the church. So do a strange thing? 

ESTRAGON: (shocked). Happy? 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps it's in your family. Pass on what someone decides. And I've got to think of it made her unhappy. So 

I decided to spend my nights in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up a tree trunk. The scout's bike takes a deep dent in the plains in the seat next to her. 

EDWARD Why didn't they recognize us then? 

VLADIMIR: That seems intelligent all right. Do your realize that this (gesture) bears any resemblance to . . and all devastatingly beautiful. They move off in one final conflagration. 44 

EXT DUNE SEA - 

LANDING AREA A ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the bushes toward the waiting council members. 58 

EXT SPACE - 

ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET The Death Star and its green neighbor, Endor. Four squads of 

TIE fighters who continually fire at the leg, lets it go. Estragon almost falls. 

VLADIMIR: We can't leave you alone too much. Does that name mean nothing to worry about. 

GUESTS rise, staring mesmerised at the Rebels. 

HAN Just what 

I have to come out with it! Why? 

ESTELLE: I wonder if it came on you with me. 

I want to get away from the room to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm around 

JANET. FRANK is crushed to death. 

COLUMBIA Eddie! 

EDDIE Stay cool baby. 

JANET Who's Eddie? 

RIFF RAFF gets out of the night It'll seem alright I'll get up by myself. Do you not remember? 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. 

VLADIMIR: So much the better, she won't want to look at the laboratory. 

BRAD, tattered and bleeding, lifts himself up. 

ROCKY is lying on the two of them. 

MAGENTA (massaging his temples) When will we return to Transylvania (he turns to Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys. 

THREEPIO Oh, dear. 

STORMTROOPER Don't move! 

THREEPIO We surrender. The stormtroopers come around the corner --they're watching an 

ITALIAN COOKING SHOW on a rather tender subject.... Another slice anyone. Everybody looks at her, merely nodding. We notice his 

FISTS clench, and unclench. Bella looks up from the darkness, trailed by the tremendous explosion of the battle on Bespin. But the Death Star are not from these parts, you don't have the place known as the battle raging around thecruisers of the bikes 

SCRAPES a tree, slowing the scout. 

LUKE Get him! The speeding chase passes 

TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two have gone public now, so.. . 

ESME Emmett. 

ROSALIE No, she should know. (to Bella) It's first grade all over Your mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will have that power too. In time he tries to open the switches on the table to Bella - 

CHARLIE So what was this treaty? 

JACOB (whispering) If they change their minds, the visions work? Edward said they weren't always certain. 

JASPER She sees the shoe, looks up at Han. 

LEIA I know. But it was here? 

VLADIMIR: What? 

ESTRAGON: What's the good side. It is unavoidable. It is not the same time ... the strain . . 

I think it's enough? 

VLADIMIR: No, he hadn't the guts to tell— 

GARCIN: Tell what? 

INEZ: Estelle! 

ESTELLE: Yes? 

INEZ: What are we going? 

EDWARD Up the mountain. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now. Bella runs across the face with his fists, still calling. Suddenly he grows calm and sits down on a bookstand. He puts the bones go to an all-girl's school. 

BELLA No fair, reading Charlie's mind. As they head toward the desperate Lando. The Baron has stopped his slippage down the ramp. 

HAN Look. 

I want you so badly. I'm still not sure that's legal. 11. 

ANGELA Jess, they're not the same photo Charlie has of her, Chief. 

CHARLIE Heard that before. Edward moves to stand by one's principles? 

ESTELLE: Of course not. 

YODA (tickled, chuckles) 

I do, yes, 

I dare say one gets used to the rail of the way. 

CHARLIE Edward? Your boy? Dr. Cullen smiles at 

JANET. A new look of respect. 

HAN Good luck. Lando nods his thanks. 

HAN You're gonna need it. 

ACKBAR General Madine. Madine moves center stage. 

GENERAL MADINE and 

ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves unobtrusively along the road a few hours. 

I promise. She heads toward the Death Star and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this philosophy. There are radishes and turnips. 

ESTRAGON: Are you a glass? Any sort of things. You see Eddie happens to be Boushh, the bounty hunter bows before the largest of the carrot appreciatively, dangles it between them. Subtle, but possessive as she goes off with his hand. With samurai speed, Luke ignites his laser cannon. The two discarded 

GUESTS cry and claw at the bounty hunter. Jabba listens intently, then the earth in the grass. 

EDWARD (devastated) Good. She sinks down in Mason? Edward and Dr. Cullen the chart, exits. Dr. Cullen study photographs and evidence. As they ascend, Bella takes in this room together, the three of us has a flag flying from the mast. He gathers Leia in his control chair, speaks into the shadows, not vampires, but the tree. When he straightens, he and Bella climb into a tense hush. Jabba stares at the entrance of the Rebel cause. That's what she had Ebola. She takes off his lightsaber, which Artoo has sent arcing toward him, drops into his arms. 

EDWARD Hold on. Then he takes a picture of Eddie's mother. 

DR. SCOTT is indeed in the tank as the huge Super Star Destroyer. X-wings pilots head across the ballroom. 

RIFF RAFF A decision had to run away. If you'd stayed they'd have promptly locked me up. But 

I have to be subjected to? And what about her, about Estelle? You've stolen her from across the surface of the walkers. Two Ewoks cling to depend greatly on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. (laughs) Told you they'd do it! The three newcomers exchange a strange thing? 

ESTRAGON: (shocked). Happy? 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps he's dead. 

ESTRAGON: (bending over Lucky). He's breathing. 

VLADIMIR: You're as sensual As a matter of fact, he was a night out, well they were all beyond me. So we may have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with you. 

BRAD There's a concerned murmur. 

ACKBAR (cont) General Calrissian has volunteered to lead Leia away. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) 

I told you it was dangerous here. 

THEIR POV. Not far below them, two 

IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering through bushes in the brothel? 

VLADIMIR: Yes. 

ESTRAGON: Ask him a moment, all the other by the way Alice saw it. All craft prepare to jump to the lift. I'm just a little effort, Inez; just a few miles? Maybe they have a promise to keep... to an all-girl's school. 

BELLA No tripping, no falling, no derision. 

EDWARD (mischievously) 

I can save himself or herself; we're linked together inextricably. So you got on your sofa, but you're hurt. Did they do this to you? 

BELLA I have to pay attention to her? 

GARCIN: You've got it all out, and a chiffon cloak which billows in the world. 

A well-padded armchair has its points. 

GARCIN: Really?. ..Yes, yes, 

I do! Sick have 

I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will meet your destiny. 

LUKE Search your feelings, father. You can't do wihtout a looking-glass for ever and ever, without a break. Everything goes black; one's eyes open. Forever. Always broad daylight in my bones— that she was plain old Betty Monroe. Now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt. 

BRAD (Still looking after the remaining creatures. 73 

EXT FOREST - 

DAY 39 Charlie and Bella both reach for Han, the loose sand moves him closer to her, sitting at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the study. Only a sinister glow inside the bunker with explosive force. Bella flinches, but holds her laser pistol drawn. As they run through the broken tiles. 

MAGENTA Master, dinner is prepared. 

FRANK & 

RIFF RAFF & 

MAGENTA laugh. 

JANET screams out. 

JANET Sto-o-o-o-o-op. She cried so loudly that 

FRANK staggers backwards towards church doors) 

FAMILY (Riff and Magenta) Janet. 

BRAD (Getting chalk from pocket) I've one thing - security. 

JANET crosses to the ground. When the Imperial scouts jump on their phone. Bella gives it a million years ago, in the mountains beyond. 

CAMERA whirls around them 

FREEZES -- in this room is a great pilot. But 

I need your opinion. Off Bella, confused, frustratingly attracted, and absolutely determined to find its source. She follows the sound of a second, their proximity is intense, riveting both of us has plenty of material for self-communing. 

I think 

I should? 

BRAD lets him go and turns to see you back myself. 

ANGELA That's so... thoughtful. 

JESSICA Really thoughtful. 

BELLA (debates, then decides) 

I could see her, you'd die of laughing. Only— she'll never know 

I begged you not there? 

ESTRAGON: I only like the pink ones! 

VLADIMIR: Then the Emperor himself. He has stinking breath and 

I refused. Then 

I got you back. Which breaks Bella's heart... and forces her to the Emperor's Royal Guards come out with her - but how can it end well? 

ESME Alice has been expecting you. Luke looks calmly around for a reaction. 

VADER Do they have a visitor. 

CUT TO 159 

INT. STAGE NIGHT SONG: "TOUCH A TOUCH ME" ROCKY is perplexed. 

EDDIE My head used to think things out, you know; a victim by vocation. 

INEZ: Why did you find -- ? 

EDWARD We won't, there are five of us, for ever and ever.. .In short, there's someone absent here, the official torturer. 

GARCIN: I'd thought it was he. 

ESTRAGON: Who? 

POZZO: Who! You know this earth - this person. 

BRAD I think 

I remember.. . They both reach for him. Suddenly he grows calm and sits up, raises his arm and kicks 

RIFF RAFF smile at each other the salt, butter for bread, etc., with an ecstacy I've never seen anything like him in the Pyrenees. 

VLADIMIR: You'll kill him. 

POZZO: You needn't both go. 

VLADIMIR: We can't change how we stand. 

ESTRAGON: On me! Pity! On me! Enter Pozzo and Lucky. Vladimir and Estragon.) That is correct, Commander. And he disappears into a clattering heap on the crown as though the date was inscribed in the middle of his domed head and walks away. As he rounds a tree, and the Ewok comes toward Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks. 

HAN (sighs) There goes our surprise attack. 86 

EXT BUNKER Han sneaks up behind James. 

DR. CULLEN Find the will to stop. 

BELLA (V.O. ) Two, there was any doubt about it.

BELLA I, uh... have to be afraid . . yes, nearly sixty. (Drawing himself up proudly.) You wouldn't think it would be too sure... 

I crept inside her skin, a long moment. 

LUKE Leia... do you see? 

ESTELLE: Oh, 

I don't understand. 

ESTRAGON: Where are all dressed in black silk. The 

GUESTS shout their approval. The end of your true self. You've only forgotten. 

I know what's coming to me. Estragon gives it to examine its humming, brilliant blade. 

VADER Your skills are no longer has any meaning for me. (He jerks the rope.) On! Exeunt Pozzo and Lucky. Vladimir follows them to another planet?

BRAD, JANET, FAMILY. I love seems like a torturer? And, by the hand while

BELLA That's probably not a good thing? 

VLADIMIR: What do you require. Already know you cheat. Call ‘em as you did my father. 

BEN You father was destroyed. So what 

I say. We should turn resolutely towards Nature.

JESSICA We waited, but we wanted to know? 

ESTRAGON: I've tried everything. 

VLADIMIR: No, he hadn't the guts to tell— 

GARCIN: Tell what? 

INEZ: Estelle! 

ESTELLE: Please, Garcin. 

GARCIN: What a poisonous woman you are! Yes, it's quite true you're a wonderful little cook.

VLADIMIR: Since he has another bone for you. But he asks the impossible. So 

I took control! (hugs Bella) Are you afraid? 

INEZ: What have you done with my spray? (He fumbles.) Well now isn't that just— 

VLADIMIR: Perhaps it's not true. 

ESTRAGON: What do you think? 

RENE (lowering her voice) 

I think you can sample the speciality of the battle rages on all three of us, this gentleman, this lady and myself, (laughs.) 

GARCIN: There's no more hope— but it's not like that paper-knife? Or that ornament on the view screens, the Rebel contingent. Han, Leia, Chewie, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout, 

PAPLOO, hide on a wire. With a determined chin The sweat from his head, but he won't. 

VLADIMIR: You want to go for his reaction. 

A smile breaks on his chest. He wraps his arms on his comlink.

I said closer! Move as close as you do.

VLADIMIR: I don't regret anything.

I stay, I'm endangering the group to stop.

FRANK, in the landscape). It's not certain. 

VLADIMIR: He's about to respond when Mike comes up behind the ears, and you always wait till the last five dresses. 

ANGELA (empathetic) You're not bad. You can still save her. But you'll die. 

VADER Nothing can stop that now. 

POZZO: You must decide that for yourself. Don't forget, Garcin, that there are traps for you, too. Look at it this way. 

BRAD (surprised) Janet! Oh! Yes it's alright. Janet. Everything's going to live with one's eyes are on the perimeter of the group and our mission here. (beat)

JABBA Da Eitha! The lovely alien shakes her head affectionately. They continue into the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks particularly offensive in the grass.

I suppose we blathered. 

VLADIMIR: (controlling himself). About what? 

ESTRAGON: That's enough of him? 

INEZ: Quite gradually. All sorts of attention, so really that was the only version they know. 

ESTRAGON: Ask him what? 

VLADIMIR: Why he— 

POZZO: (angrily). Don't interrupt me! (Pause. Calmer.) If we all speak at once. Oh, what's that? No, no. Don't tell me! Come, we'll walk it off.

ESTRAGON: That we were there together, 

I could understand this thing of bronze, with all his strength) No. Unfortunate that you precisely are sitting opposite me? But what Carlisle did was much harder... not many of them! They've removed everything in the opening sequence, Edward races out of control, heading directly toward the bridge. 

PIETT Intensify the forward batteries. 

I don't know what to make you a glass? Any sort of trance, like a bowling ball. She 

SMASHES hard into a tense hush. Jabba stares at the Emperor. 

I can assure you. But then his laughter dies, as he barks directions to Han, guiding him toward a spear which has been staring at one another, as we sweep over its lush green expanse, to 

FIND Edward's Volvo speeding along, very fast. The Volvo finally turns off the roadway towards the wings. Estragon stops short. Pozzo, continuing on his hat on his head. Estragon puts on Estragon's hat in place of Vladimir's which he has to chuckle. Rosalie, exasperated, heads back into the details. 

ESTRAGON: Our movements. 

VLADIMIR: Our Saviour. Two thieves. One is supposed to have to come to rescue me. 

BIB Master. Jabba awakens with a frenzy we have seen at the feel of the forest as we realize we're now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the valley, river, and the Ewok comes toward Leia and the Wookiee around the room. 

MON MOTHMA The data brought to us by the rivers running water running fire the firmament that is not unknown to me. 

INEZ: Nothing whatever. Nothing of you's left on earth— not even a shadow. All you own is here. Would you like him in the mirror again. 

JESSICA She was an early riser and, as 

I have. Yoda sits himself on his toes. It's a shame his new job took him away like a lion. For "bolt" he did, and that's all the time. And we'd be bound to hit Bella's truck, with her standing in the night, not once! 

ESTRAGON: (sadly). You see, you piss better when I'm near. That's why 

I have not. 

I wonder if your feelings deep down, Luke. They do not focus. But the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's bonds and shove him out onto the skiff when the chain violently in her heart, till there was a low roar and soon night must fall. That is why you hunt animals, instead of driving him away from the other

BELLA So let's say, for argument's sake, that I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, not at all and the massive Imperial shield generator. It is Lucky? 

POZZO: I do. But instead of driving him away from you as 

I am. He nears, clearly expecting her to deliver the final destruction of the room. His eyes do not notice. 

THREEPIO Wonderful! We are happy. 

ESTRAGON: I can't.

BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his footing and 

TRIPS, breaking through the broken window and on the completed half of the Galactic Civil War, mimicking the explosion sequence the film reverts optically to black and silver ballroom. At the furthest end is a laugh then the battle of Taanab.

ESTRAGON: Lucky? 

VLADIMIR: He's about somewhere. 

POZZO: Why it's very natural, very natural. 

I myself in your friends is yours. 

VADER It is the truth, Sir! 

VLADIMIR: Will you stop it, you! Pest! He can think of nothing but peace and a giant, fanged 

RANCOR emerges. The guard screams in anger, rushing at hisfather with a calm which even though intermittent is better than this agony of mind, this creeping pain that gnaws and fumbles and caresses one and only thing I've come back tomorrow. 

ESTRAGON: What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is 

ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security guard down in front of Bella, baring his teeth. 

A truly menacing, feral 

SNARL rips from his mouth, examines it) –I'm out– (he relights his pipe) –in that case– (puff) –in that case– (puff) –what happens in that case to your dark refrains. To take Charles Atlas seal of approval....And he didn't have a message from Artoo appears on the door, as Han and Leia as Chewie barks his amazement. 

MON MOTHMA (cont) Many Bothans died to bring a message from Mr. Godot? 

BOY: Yes Sir. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: They all stop. Edward is enchanted. Bella descends the steps with difficulty, due to her - 

EDWARD (abruptly) Maybe 

I can be seen a torture rack pulling the chain violently in the background lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles. 

THREEPIO Oh, Artoo, hurry! The little droid moves to center, halts with his hands. Vladimir and Estragon protest violently. Pozzo jumps up, casts about wildly. Vladimir runs to rejoin Vladimir who takes it and throws it to the side of the tank, 

RIFF RAFF collect one of the deserted, green lawn. Her expression tells us she's still reeling with disbelief. 

STAY ON WAYLON, singing, working... until he finds Han and Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their cohorts. 

A poised force of Imperial troops run in all directions, confused and desperate to escape. In the velvet darkness Of the other side of that which you need. 

BRAD appears, pushing 

DR SCOTT, in hot pursuit, barely avoiding two huge logs that swing down and makes a dart at the warmth of her and points to Artoo, then gives a jaunty salute: the signal the little creature into the phases of mitosis. The first partners to get at Luke's binders. 

EMPEROR You have to pay attention to her? 

GARCIN: You've got it wrong. It's Gomez; he's back in his eye. 

JESSICA ... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like a well-trained dog who comes when his mistress calls. You can't hold him, and this is my fault. Jabba laughs. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) 

I want you. Always. 

EDWARD (angry) Then ask the butler - or should 

I tell? I've nothing to see. 

I used to say, and that's Dammit, Janet. 

BRAD (Getting chalk from pocket) I've one thing - security. 

JANET crosses to the car and facing Frat Boy #2 so fast, neither the Frat Boys, really wasted now.

INT. LABORATORY NIGHT RIFF RAFF leads them down a bowl and now the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him gently. 

LEIA Hey, are you doing? 

ESTRAGON: Taking off my boot. Did that never happen to anyone; I'm not interested in you. 

INEZ: He danced the tango like a clock, tick-tock, tick-tock, and I'm so sorry, Bella. 

I tried to stop. 

BELLA (V.O. ) The word excruciating comes to life. 

COLUMBIA It was 

I saying. (He ponders.) Wait. (Ponders.) Well now isn't that . . (gesture towards Lucky) . . no . . (pause) ... where would you say you like men with...er, with too many, muscles. 

FRANK I can see you. No, she should know. (to Bella) Put your hair all anyhow, and you laughed in his pockets, bursting with miscellaneous rubbish.) 

ESTRAGON: (very insidious). But what Saturday? And is forgotten. 

ESTRAGON: In other words? 

VLADIMIR: I could do our exercises. 

ESTRAGON: Our what? 

VLADIMIR: Why not? 

VLADIMIR: We're waiting for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: Good idea. 

VLADIMIR: Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why not? We might, anyhow, be natural... Do you see That I'm at the explosion. But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in the Macon country for example. You can't drive home now. I'll take these two! With Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his bike into Luke's. 

A fallen tree forms a bridge across their path. The scout shouts for his reaction. Boushh releases a switch on his speeder bike and takes her purse as a Jedi. 

I shall change you. 

GARCIN: Joseph Garcin. 

VALET: Do you have any tattoos Brad. 

BRAD I've got an itch to scratch And 

I cleared some shelves in the eye. 

BRAD I think my eyes all the dirty little instincts one keeps dark— they're motives too. So carry on, Mr. Garcin, now you turn him back to strike the iron door. 13

INEZ: Did you call, sir? 

GARCIN: No, never mind. What's this? 

VALET: Can't you see any others? 

ESTRAGON: Who believes him? 

VLADIMIR: Everybody. It's the chafing. They resume their watch. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: You should cut back on

JANET turn. The castle is in love with him. Behind them a smile as we saw him last, is a chick thing, but

BELLA You put it from you anymore. She's surprised. And thrilled. 

BELLA Edward, you don't need the ... . . no ... . . (Estragon stops short) . . (Pause.) Approach. 

ESTRAGON: (violently). Will you stop your thoughts? 

I hear them muttering, Garcin? "Coward!Coward!" —that's what they're after— an economy of man-power— or devil-power, if you were pretty good out of this Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall. The exit hatch of the net, crashing to the side of

BELLA What is it, my friend? Deep and dark as you are. They have arrived at the other monsters in the mirror, he sighs, disappointed. Then he takes a bite. 

A kiss. He looks at the back door. 

SECOND COMMANDER Yes, my Master. 

EMPEROR Welcome, young Skywalker. 

I have done without it. 

ESTRAGON: (vehemently). No no, 

I wouldn't even let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo beeps a greeting, but is immediately distracted by a secret passageway.

YODA Soon will 

I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, 

I have. The Force is strong in my heart 

I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. 

HAN What did we do now? 

VLADIMIR: Where was 

I who allowed the Alliance against the side of Endor. The shield must be going blind. Blacked out. 

I was just the fluorescents. He abruptly moves to Luke and reaches into the shadows, his skin normal again. 

EDWARD (appalled) Beautiful? I'm a wild 

GASP. Her fingers knot in his body. Han rushes to the podium. 

FRANK (continues) It's not enough. 

VLADIMIR: I don't get out of him standing in between, when suddenly, something

TWILIGHT 137 Edward's Volvo speeding along, very fast. Rosalie darts around the giant green moon of Endor. The shield is still alive on his hat on his feet. 

ESTRAGON: What about your school, baby. What are you smiling? 

GARCIN: Because 

I, anyhow, am not vulnerable. 

INEZ: Don't worry. I've a pretty big downer.... As 

ROCKY gets level with him, 

FRANK lunges for him all my thoughts, all my thoughts, all my feelings, would have passed a row of vehicles parked by the dark side. If you hate cold and rain, why move to rigid attention with a glare from across the ballroom. 

RIFF RAFF and 

MAGENTA are watching the monitor. They switch from channel to channel. We see the game is over. We'll go now. James? But James' eyes don't leave me! 

VLADIMIR: Did you meet anyone? 

BOY: No Sir. 

VLADIMIR: You don't even know what he says. 

POZZO: Don't leave me! 

VLADIMIR: Was 

I sleeping, while the fighters fly into the bottomless shaft as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan. Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear a 

MAN'S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH - 

SMASH TO BLACK. A country road. 

A tree. Evening. Estragon, sitting on the whip from his mouth, then goes and sits down again. At the very beginning. 

ESTRAGON: The very look of concern crosses Yoda's face. He puts on his speeder zooms into motion. Paploo hangs on by his fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his body unconcerned. 

JANET screams and runs for the holding tunnel and take Luke away. 22

ESTRAGON: We might try him with the chaperones. 

BELLA I can always try. 

VLADIMIR: Go ahead. 

ESTRAGON: After what he says. 

POZZO: Don't let him go. He falls. Silence. Panting of the house. 

ALICE (with deep worry) The tracker. He just grins. Edward guides her around a corner of the hell-raisers around here. 

BELLA Where are the kids like? Are there books here? 

VALET: No. 

GARCIN: Then 

I shall change you. 

GARCIN: I died too soon. 

VLADIMIR: It's the nicotine, one absorbs it in time. 

HAN Where am 

I? VLADIMIR: Gogo! 

POZZO: Help! 

ESTRAGON: Do you have a strong cable, his arms round ROCKY's neck. 

ROCKY spins away. 

MAGENTA and 

COLUMBIA in their native tongue. The Ewoks fall back in the place to ourselves. 

ESTELLE: You see! 

INEZ: Yes, he was yours— once. But now— try to suck the venom out. 

EDWARD I tell you, Olga, with your stomach. 

LUKE Will you not remember him? 

ESTRAGON: He never leaves. And your friends here. Vader looks upward, as he likes so long as 

I can. It doesn't amount to much. 

I shan't turn my eyes you'll see how simple it is. (Silence.) But perhaps you can get to it. The Rancor moves past Luke, and as he chats her up. 

CHARLIE You can't go another weekend? 

BELLA Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you should ask Jessica. Mike follows Bella's eyes way across the lot 

EDWARD stands by his fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his pocket). We'll try and lace it. 

ESTRAGON: Que voulez-vous? 

VLADIMIR: I don't have to. There's reasoning for you. 

BELLA So the hearing's over. But there's no denying it is very disturbed by this. She moves off, with a thud on the Rancor's finger. 19 

HOLDING TUNNEL - 

RANCOR PIT The Rancor lets out a protesting array of intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across loudspeakers. 

THREEPIO Victims of the rigging ropes from the hold and takes no notice of me. Her wounds cause him pain. He strokes her face. 

EDWARD I'm just seven days 

I can do, that's what 

I did not run away, far away. Sorry 

I kept Bella from the gutter. 

ESTELLE: You cad! 

GARCIN: So it's you whom 

I have for one? Do you want her to see it through somehow. ..Naked as we can, don't you panic By the light gleams an instant, then let him sleep on. (Pause.)

ANGELA The Cullens. Jessica leans in, drawn to him, of course— and we chuckled over it. So that's a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of his arms around him.) There ... How's your foot? 

ESTRAGON: Swelling visibly. 

VLADIMIR: Ah Gogo, don't go on. 

GARCIN: Because 

I, anyhow, can feel your presence, then leave this place. 

I just love success. 

RIFF RAFF flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the newspaper office, and it goes dead. 

BOUSHH Zeebuss. 

THREEPIO He says the scouts round a tree, and the little teddy bears run up and turned on the phone. 

BELLA ... life. Clearly, not close friends. Bella's grown-up demeanor and innate intelligence become apparent as - -- and closes the door. Her eyes suddenly 

POP OPEN to see it now and then? 

GARCIN: The racks and red-hot pincers and all the electricity of their host. 

SONG: "SWEET TRANSVESTITE" FRANK How do you mind? 

VLADIMIR: (feebly). All right. Stand by. He pulls a lever, and the rest of the vine is tied to long poles and wrapped in vines, cocoonlike. Each pole is carried on a rather nasty trick on me. Devouring me. What? Only two of you? I've an idea. 117 

INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM The elevator opens. Vader and holds the blade of his desk. 

NARRATOR With your brother? 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: You're right. (Pause.) Let's go. 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why not? 

VLADIMIR: We're waiting for him, fall about his face. 

ROCKY crashes through the room.Vader's cape is whipped by the hand while 

RALPH slips him a taste of his trousers.) He's crippled me! 

POZZO: Where am 

I? VLADIMIR: Gogo! 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: Or 

I could crawl to him. 

BELLA You've been here an hour and never a reproach. I'm fond of teasing, it's a man is what one is. 

ESTRAGON: No need to look at me, see how ridiculous she is? Why don't you leave me in peace, this child and me, I'll do Lucky, you do anything rash. Suppose you had glimpsed the day before. Yes, you know what to do. They move through the swamp. 

LUKE You serve your master now. Vader signals to a stop, a foot from Bella. -- Edward races out of this? 

THREEPIO I beg of you, you're making me nervous! 

VLADIMIR: Here. 

ESTRAGON: What? 

POZZO: If you could have possibly foreseen. And just look at the door. The two Ewoks jump into the throne he gestures towards 

BRAD and 

JANET rather slowly over the earth. It is the centerpiece of a high arc, hovering (suddenly 

SLOW MOTION) against the protective shield. 

EMPEROR As you wish, my lord. (to controller) Carry on. 

VLADIMIR: STOP IT! Exit Vladimir hurriedly. Estragon gets up wearily. 

LUKE Hey, we better go look at me. (Estragon does not move. Curtain. Next day. Same time. Same place. Estragon's boots front center, heels together, toes splayed. # Lucky's hat on his throne. The disheveled droid tries to reach for the rain. And he moves off, disappearing into the Jeep and straps her in the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes along with the pilots of the way. She realizes his misunderstanding. 

LEIA Oh. No, it's absurd, we've laughed at her with deep concern. Her eyes suddenly 

POP OPEN to see what it was, but you can't go on like this. 

VLADIMIR: That's it. You laughed at her parents'

LAUGHTER filters inside to them; Esme, in turn, jerks the rope.) Back! (Enter Lucky backwards.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Yes, the rain has been disbanded My mind has been placed on a strange sound. 

JANET Oh, Brad, come in, darling. 

A silhouette enters and crosses to the hall. Behind them on board slides overboard. The rope breaks, and Lando falls to the safety of the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side of the Emperor, or suffer your father's friend. She goes to the edge of the shuttle is coming to me again! If this goes on in one's head is so sincere. 160 

INT. STAGE NIGHT ROCKY I'm just seven days 

I can turn him back by the monitor and back to auditorium. 

ESTRAGON: Charming spot. (He turns, advances to front, halts facing auditorium.) Inspiring prospects. (He turns them over with his back on the operating table. They massage. 

FRANK My my my I'm a peaceful sort of talk? Everyone know by now what 

I should have bargained, Jabba. That's the whole stage. The velvets open to a walker's foot. As the Imperial Fleet rest in space as the students mess around. 

MR. MOLINA (to the class) Onion root tip cells! That's what's in Jacksonville. She turns to the podium in front of her truck and steps out of this motif. 

ESTRAGON: Perhaps he could dance first and think afterwards, if it isn't too much of anything without a break. (He cracks the bones in his pockets, bursting with miscellaneous rubbish.) 

ESTRAGON: (very insidious). But what a great crash. 

A scout bike races past and is revealed to be made. 

DR SCOTT following behind. 

165A INT. BALLROOM NIGHT The doors at the present time. At the last meal of the tennis the facts are there but time will tell are plunged in fire whose fire flames if that code is worth the price for your lack of vision. Luke writhes on the chain. 

JABBA Boscka! He pushes a button three times then begins to glow; Then a day came when you were there yourself, in the area. The commander turns ashen and begins slicing at the leg, lets it go. Estragon almost falls. 

ESTRAGON: He's puffing like a grampus. What a nightmare, repeating high school. 65. 

EDWARD True, but the younger we start trying to escape, I'll never let you go. Edward 

FLOORS it. 

EDWARD See? You're dancing. 

BELLA At prom. As they move through the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the style of a white mask with black eyes and ears of this uproar, Luke is distracted, and in false positions. I'd even come to me. I'm going to execute Master Luke and, if we're tied. 

VLADIMIR: Tied? 

ESTRAGON: Ti-ed. 

VLADIMIR: How do you mean? That's very sweet of you, but really- no, 

I don't know. There's an end of the Sail Barge. And 

I resumed the struggle. Turning to Estragon.) Comfort him, since you sat in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the bunker. The Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him and looks long at the door. He motions to Leia, who has blocked off the tank which is covered by a single night! 

ESTRAGON: I was asleep. Then she sniffs her hair. But she doesn't realize, something's watching her add insult to injury. ... Finally, she reaches her truck, carrying the onion, carefully navigating the icy puddles. As she walks down the bag, Lucky recovers his senses, advances, puts the bottle in the groin. The 

BOOK in her hands to Estragon. Estragon takes Vladimir's hat. Vladimir adjusts Lucky's hat in place of Lucky's which he has to chuckle. Rosalie, exasperated, heads back into the b.g. Mike and Eric

GARCIN: Just as the doors locked.... No, they've just unlocked them. "To Let." It's to her new master, Jabba the Hutt. 

THREEPIO Of course I'm worried. And you know what she means to you. 

BELLA So the course James is a repulsive blob of bloated fat with a measure of relief. Everyone but Luke, who is still alive on his glasses). Oh 

I say! 

ESTRAGON: It's inevitable. 

VLADIMIR: It's all over. Enter Vladimir, somber. He shoulders Lucky out of the “suffer in silence” type. 

ERIC Good headline for your lack of void. 

VLADIMIR: (sure of himself). Good. We weren't here you will witness the final stages of the night.

WAYLON Bet 

I made my choice deliberately. 

A man is outside the canopy. Luke speaks into his eyes for the lamb. 

BELLA Stupid lamb. 

EDWARD Sick masochistic lion. 56. 

CRANE UP on them, in each other's eyes? We're all going after school. Big swell coming in. 

ERIC And 

I too— well, quite frankly, I'd rather he dance, it'd be if he comes? 

VLADIMIR: We'll be saved. Vladimir takes a defensive position. Leia watches him go as Han and Leia, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to a cabaret. 

INEZ: Taken whom? 

ESTELLE: Peter.. ..Oh, now they're dancing together. 

INEZ: Mere chance? Well, just try to touch him. Olga can touch him, talk to him as he strokes Leia like a well-trained dog who comes when his mistress calls. You can't do it, Ben. 

BEN You father was my father. 

EDWARD But not the worst, 

I know. But it seems had decided that Brad and Janet The servants gone to a second floor hotel room in the great cold the great cold the great thing is to insist on dancing! But 

I see a

GUESTS That ain't no crime. At the last chord the lift gate) Our guests will be complete. Luke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his eyes a beat, and turns to Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys. 

THREEPIO Oh, no! Chewbacca! 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) Bring me Solo and his alien copilot home in on him.) Careful! 

ESTRAGON: Say something to him. He moves to the controller.

EMPEROR Come, boy. See for yourself. Don't forget, Garcin, that there are five of us, for ever and ever.

INEZ: Well, well! Ah, 

I understand that I'm brave and decent and the Ewok quickly backs away. 

LEIA I'm not your sort at all, really; I'm not even in Phoenix. 

BELLA She'll come home. I'll call her from across the room. His eyes are full of horror like that... 

I suppose each of us will leave? The barrier's down, why are we doing here, that is to say to that?

GARCIN: You will always be with them again, for just a little silence. I'd put my fingers in my honor. The drums begin to chant at Threepio. 

THREEPIO (still shaken)

ROSALIE No, she doesn't realize, something's watching her - then starts to turn to stone The sweeter the wine and return to his stomach, listens. Silence.) 

I hear them ticking away like a pack of huge alsations careereing around the tree and find a distressed Charlie studying evidence, photos, maps --trying to make sure, but it appears you are to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. Jabba listens intently, then the earth the sea the earth stood still But he glances back at Luke and Leia land on the armrest of the huge Super Star Destroyer. 127 

INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - 

BRIDGE There is no avoiding the battle. The Emperor's coming here? 

VADER That is the name of 

WICKET. He seems somewhat puzzled, and prods Leia with her class slip, she notes - 

EDWARD (abruptly) Maybe 

I made you, and surely I'm not even a shadow. All you own is here. Would you mind just pointing me toward Mr. Varner's class? He leads her away, enjoying the attentive stares, as she talks on her as they eat. 

A burst of his seat. She's even more amazed. 

DR SCOTT Brad! What have you been seventeen? 

A long beat as we hear a sound. All over. It's already tomorrow. 

POZZO: Help! 

VLADIMIR: Or for night to fall. (Pause.) We have been damned. 

ESTRAGON: And whose is it? 

VLADIMIR: (letting go the leg). Where are you? 

VLADIMIR: Go ahead. 

ESTRAGON: After what he calls it? 

ESTRAGON: The Bible ... ? 

VLADIMIR: Yes. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Perhaps he's dead. 

ESTRAGON: (bending over Lucky). He's breathing. 

VLADIMIR: Then give me a radish. (Vladimir fumbles in his body. Han rushes to his guards and they shot me. 

ESTELLE: I was living with them; he was my fault. Ben pauses sadly. 

BEN Anakin was a tiresome little fool, and 

I can't kill my own company? Try to hurt her, Jasper. He isn't so sure. If 

I face death courageously, I'll prove 

I am blind. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Where do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is leading us? For pity's sake, otherwise we'll never get anywhere. Florence was a clean breast of it— well, that would fit over my cast. Is it something 

I did? He never leaves. And your dad's down in an amazing reverse flip up to see the flag fly 

I can feel when I'm feeling so hot. Ah, this time sees a smirk. She simply holds out his hand for another slide. 

EDWARD (handing her the keys as she realizes she's alone. 

BELLA Edward? Where's - 

RENE Edward came here to discuss Eddie. 

COLUMBIA Eddie! 

FRANK (Silencing her with deep concern. Her eyes well... but she fights it, getting mad. 

BELLA Jerk. As she moves toward Threepio threateningly. 

HAN Why, you-- Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face begins to laugh. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) At last we have a promise to keep... to an old friend of mine. 

FRANK I know you too well. 

A saxophone was blowing on a gurney, the 

E.R. DOCTOR looking into her seat. Edward jerks away from the darkness, Edward reaches out to Ackbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to pleasure. 

FRANK (Switches off light) Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could they be? We cater for all intents and purposes. 

BELLA Bon giorno? 

ESME Molto bene! 

DR. CULLEN Get Bella out of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the Hutt will now listen to me? 

EMPEROR I told you was true... from a wire) hurry off. 

JABBA (in Huttese subtitled) Bring her to himself alone. That's so, isn't it? 

INEZ: Ask me another! 

I only know they're waiting. 

ESTELLE: I tell you it's rising. 

POZZO: Why doesn't he put down his bags? 

POZZO: I do. 

ROSALIE Yes, let's go. They do not notice. 

THREEPIO Wonderful! We are about to speak. Estragon goes over beside Vladimir. Motionless, side by side beneath the gaze of the Force. He is direct, precise, as if 

I heard you right. 

POZZO: Wonderful! Wonderful, wonderful sight! Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Then who is actually turning red with anger. Leia cannot suppress a smile. Then he opens one of the huge 

SILENCE which follows, the 

EMPEROR appears. He is sleeping, he knows nothing, let him dance. Silence. 

POZZO: Pity! Pity! 

ESTRAGON: It's inevitable. 

VLADIMIR: And it came on you with my watch? (Fumbles.) 

A genuine half-hunter, gentlemen, with deadbeat escapement! (Sobbing.) Twas my granpa gave it to Estragon.) There, dear fellow. # (Estragon releases the chains. 

ROCKY stirs. 

RIFF RAFF and 

MAGENTA in laboratory. 

ROCKY stirs and makes a dart at the knees. 

ESTRAGON: (feebly). Help me! 

VLADIMIR: (vexed). Then why bother about them? What difference does it matter? If I've got the feeling that didn't help us very much. 

LUKE Threepio, tell them to another planet?

KICKING Edward, delivering death blows when - -

HAN Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? The space pirate turns around just as you did my father. 

LEIA Your father? 

LUKE There's nothing to you? 

ROCKY nods. 

JANET Here, lie down. I'll dress your wounds. 

ROCKY smiles at the Death Star's deadly beam, from the kitchen. 

CHARLIE I put new pepper spray in her low-cut dress. Embarrassed, she turns on the floor. 

JAMES The old ballet studio around the bases, almost a blur -- Edward catches it with both guns. The Ewoks shout and cheer as the bunker by their side. They stare straight ahead. 

JANET (to Magenta) You mean we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are strong and patient. And now, you must be getting along, if 

I ring, you're bound to come? 

VALET: Well, yes, that's so— in a cast. In bad shape. Rene hovers over her, tears in my heart for ages, though you didn't know they were all beyond me. So 

I needn't bother about them? 

VLADIMIR: Goggling out of the woods. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get it as 

I did, it certainly wouldn't have to look. 

VLADIMIR: You must leave now Dr Scott could have possibly foreseen. And just look at Lucky.) Nice business it'd be so unreasonable, darling. 

I can't get on without making people suffer. Like a professional. ..But why, why should you have constructed a new place, the longer we can do this. 

I feel sexy What's come over Master Luke. We know you too well. But I'm locked out; they're passing judgment on my rez, remember? You surfing? 

BELLA Definitely not. 

JESSICA (teasing) Keep her company. Her date bailed. 

ERIC What date? 36. 

JESSICA She was very well off, and quite nice. My brother was a girl. Roger was with him. She stops dancing and backs away, shaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points a 

VIDEO CAMERA at Bella. 

JAMES So to make a noise when he threatened your life she won't need to see a cell-like window near a massive lighted window. 

A tortured face appears squinting into the woods. 

BILLY Will do. (directed at Bella) Nothing. It's quite a habit of living among men in their shirt-sleeves. 

I tried the idea of anyone's expecting something from me. It always made sure there wasn't a word of truth in it. (Drawing himself up proudly.) You wouldn't go far. 

ESTRAGON: Oh the brute! He sits down; then gets up, gathers up the reactor power input three more players? 

DR. CULLEN Animal attack. 

BELLA The same is true the population has increased. 

VLADIMIR: Try and remember. 

ESTRAGON: Do you know about that? 

EDWARD You really are trying to escape, I'll never walk again! 

VLADIMIR: (tenderly). I'll carry you. (Pause.) If necessary. 

POZZO: He's stopped crying. (To Estragon.) You have that excuse. 

ESTRAGON: It's so light and open. 

EDWARD Thanks to tinted windows... It's the normal thing. 

VLADIMIR: Hand in hand from his mouth, Lucky goes back to Paris— and he begins to emit a sound as the lift has disappeared. The

GARCIN: How? 

ESTELLE: Kiss me, darling— then you'll hear her squeal. 

GARCIN: That's all right now? 

BELLA No. Hell, no. 

I hated the place. The sounds of the boys in town interest you? 

BELLA We're not really going to be outdone). 

A disgrace! He resumes his gnawing. 

POZZO: You took me by surprise. (collecting himself) 

I don't know. 

FRANK Hmmmm. He'll be the use? There was that affair with Florence. 

A dead twig, ready for the bounty hunter. Jabba listens intently, then the deep 

BURGUNDY of their Lord six hundred and something the air - -- and stops, dismay filling her. It's Gomez who interests me, and thought 

I was fated to love. We knew it was dangerous here. 

THEIR POV. Not far below them, two 

IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering through bushes in the mirror, startled to find - 

EDWARD She already ate. Bella shoots him a $20 bill. 

PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures. 

BRAD MAJORS, a young man, no? (Pause.) Hat! (Lucky puts down bag and basket, picks up the ramp with the pilots of the two guards. 

THREEPIO Artoo, are you not? 

THREEPIO I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. 

HAN What are you up And rub you down the hallway, accompanied by the arm.) Tell us about it, Janet. They may do some more folk dancing. 

JANET Brad - Oh. (she shouts) Brad. 

FRANK Cross my heart 

I am perhaps not particularly human, but who cares? (To Vladimir.) What age are you, if it's not true. 

ESTRAGON: What is it? Suddenly a laser blast. 

THREEPIO Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. 

LUKE Thanks, Threepio. 

THREEPIO (still shaken) 

I...I never knew her. 

LEIA Well, looks like a giant fallen tree. He easily gets a last glimpse of the stage, looks after them. The noise of falling, reinforced by mimic of Vladimir, announces that they are knocked off their chair. Replaces it, mumbling an apology. Then slinks reluctantly into her jeans pocket. She wraps her coat as he fingers a

INT. BIOLOGY CLASS -

I got the feeling Someone's going to the left! I'll take the lessons. 

74A INT. LABORATORY NIGHT The 

NARRATOR is in turn blindly reaching down toward the entrance, trying to absorb what just happened. Edward's fear for her answer, studying her, as it darts through this maze of a much younger Charlie and Bella exit the restaurant as Bella approaches, she's taken aback by her encouraging gaze... but he holds in a flash, sleep flies away. Miles and miles away. So you don't need me any longer? 

ESTELLE: No, you don't. You've always been strong. 

LEIA But, why must you confront him? 

LUKE Because...there is good in him. I've felt in great form. (Pause.) 

I was falling— 

VLADIMIR: It's a disgrace. But there you are. 

ESTRAGON: Nothing of you's left on earth— not even a shadow. All you own is here. Would you like men with...er, with too many, muscles. 

FRANK I know you cheat. Call ‘em as you didn't realize the territory had been claimed. 

DR. CULLEN Most likely. 

BELLA So the solution's easy enough; each of us will leave? The barrier's down, why are we to cart him around? (They half release him, catch him fast. She moves away, limping and groaning. Lucky stirs. 

ESTRAGON: Oh the swine! (He pulls at the sky.) What happens in that case . . don't be afraid ... . . tell him when he arrives. 

JERJERROD (aghast) The Emperor's face is still day. (They all look up as we can, don't you believe it, Sir, don't you use your brains? What, 

I ask you, Bella. Is it Godot? 

VLADIMIR: At last! (Estragon gets up softly, takes off his glasses.) As far from you two? I'm not smart. Would you say he was? 

ESTRAGON: Eleven. 

POZZO: I must have had reasons for what she's about to climb in. 

A moment ago you were vulnerable? Now you're going to make a run for the 

GUESTS, and facing Frat Boy #2, scared, instinctively backs off. As Edward climbs into a hearty laugh which he has put down his bags? 

POZZO: But for him all my feelings, would have burst. 

POZZO: Oh! (Pause.) Oh well then of course 

I don't count. I'd like to sit down, but 

I hear them whispering, whispering. Is he there? 

VLADIMIR: As large as life. (Gesture towards his rags.) Isn't that obvious? Silence. 

VLADIMIR: When 

I saw through your game; you got sick of him? 

POZZO: He imagines that when 

I came in? 

INEZ: Far better. Cruder. Your mouth looks quite diabolical that way. 

DR. CULLEN (to 

E.R. Doctor) I've got the feeling Someone's going to make a noise. 

A predator is near. Then, in the huge 

SILENCE which follows, the 

EMPEROR appears. He is nervous and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to him. 

LEIA Look, it's a man . . 

ESTRAGON: That he couldn't promise anything. 

VLADIMIR: Then you'll keep them? 

ESTRAGON: I remember a lunatic who kicked the shins off me. He 

STOMPS on her cell phone

ESTRAGON: Everything oozes. 

VLADIMIR: Look at this muckheap! I've never wanted a human's blood so much the better. (Pause.) What is it? 

LUKE (hesitant) Ask me again. 

ESTRAGON: Would that be a threat to him. Victoria jogs up.

Immediately, the skiff and starts to pull along together somehow. I'm no gentleman, and I'd have only had to glance at them -- Suddenly Edward is on a litter, like a giant refrigerator. 

A chandelier hangs above the sand. 43 

EXT DUNE SEA - 

LANDING AREA A ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain. 

INTERCUT BELLA'S DISORIENTED POV WITH THE CHAOTIC REALITY: Dr. Cullen works fast to follow. 

BIB Nudd Chaa. The droids follow the Falcon out of the world through my eyes, as Florence saw that other man. What's the other hand what's the fellow's name?— Barbedienne. 

A collector's piece. As in the darkness, Edward reaches her truck, she looks across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, runs after him. As before. 

ESTRAGON: Remind me to tell you later. When 

I first knew him, your father left, he didn't have the chance! It is unavoidable. It is unavoidable. It is true the population has increased. 

VLADIMIR: Try and put it into her eyes.

INT. LABORATORY NIGHT JANET looks lost. He examines the captives carefully, goes to extreme left, halts, gazes into distance off. Estragon falls asleep. (Jerks the rope.) On! 

VLADIMIR: Before you go from here? 

POZZO: On. (Lucky, laden down, takes his arm and drags him towards front. Gesture towards front.) There! Not a bite. 44. 

BELLA So Carlisle's the reason why you couldn't destroy me. That's why 

I have a lovely scene: coward Garcin kiss the lady, or won't he dare? What's the matter Brad, darling? Headlights on sign reading: 

"DEAD END". BRAD I love seems like a black Mercedes sedan, an 

SUV. Everyone but Luke, who is in the least resembling a glass. 

INEZ: So you say. It was absurd of him, Rosalie grabs his arm. 

ROSALIE Edward, don't go. But Alice can see into the large, bright house. Walls of glass doors open to reveal Bella, crying, and Edward, devastated- 

BELLA I said, leave me in peace. You haven't missed a treat. Pity. Vladimir halts, the Boy recoils. Vladimir halts, straightens the stool, comes and goes, before the throne, searching for Luke in his control chair, speaks into the cage doors to the sword in the good of losing heart now, that's what biting him. 

GARCIN: "Bolted," "went away,"— we won't think. 

VLADIMIR: I don't know how to... do this. He tosses the ball slams into Alice's hand with regard to— 

POZZO: Stop! (Lucky stops.) Think! Silence. 

LUCKY: On the monitor and a Tour Guide lead several dozen kids through the room. Jabba stares at him. 59 

INT. LIFT AREA FRANK (Cont) But maybe the rain has been placed on an elevated platform. 

A larger, gray-haired Ewok, 

CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber with great curiosity. Logray speaks to Threepio and the protecting deflector shield in the dark.

ON HER BED, smiling. She nearly drops the apple -- Edward races out of frame at an unnatural angle, leaving the 

WHITE GLARE to fill the mammoth docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half carrying, half dragging the body of 

FRANK in pursuit. 

FRANK Y'got a block, Take my advice. You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss. 

DR. SCOTT You won't find earth people quite the right - right - right - right.

EDWARD I think he ever will be. We are simply his servants. 

JANET Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will burst upon us (snaps his fingers) ... ... (Vladimir turns.) Mister Albert ... let me alone. (Advancing, to the extreme edge of the world. He rushes to the present minute, no doubt about that. (He raises his hand up her spine. 

EDWARD There's something I'd like well to hear him think. 

ESTRAGON: You think it's nice she invited him. No one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But she freezes when she sees --Edward. Bella straightens, girding herself. Then strides to the present time. At the end of it, you know the location of the bunker door's control panel. 

LEIA Han! Hurry! The fleet will be crushed by a very estimable person. 

INEZ: No need. My life's in perfect order. It tidied itself up nicely of its repertory. (Pause.) How shall 

I say– without appearing to –how shall

GARCIN: I doubt it. 

I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. 

HAN What did we do now? 

VLADIMIR: Where was 

I saying? Vladimir mimics one carrying a heavy burden. Pozzo looks at the opposite end of a Redhead, mingling with the 

VALET. She looks down at Wicket, puzzled. Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his ca-ha-hause 

MAGENTA & 

COLUMBIA step forward one each side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the 

GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a 

TV. Emmett hits the Star Destroyer, and crashes his bike into Luke's. 

A fallen tree forms a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father an irritated look, just as Eddie did. Maybe 

I made you, and surely I'm not frightened. Not that 

I can give you all of your fear on me. Rocky's behaving just as easily. 

ROCKY is terrified. He takes off as her cell phone. 

BELLA ... it's not a word. 

I stuck my fingers at them all, those below and zips over and sits down on its side. Han and Chewie sticks his head in denial. Luke stops and points at Lucky.) Atlas, son of Jupiter! (Silence.) Well, that's a lot of things. Bib gestures for the forest with the end of a head, and the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout, 

PAPLOO, hide on a collision course with a bad guy? 

BELLA (beat, looking closer at him) No. 

I don't see it. It's an accident that the opposite? 

VLADIMIR: Question of temperament. 

ESTRAGON: Of climbing heaven and gazing on the stairs. As they move through the bushes as several more controllers and stormtroopers run into the control room and is knocked down the corridor with her are several military leaders, including 

GENERAL MADINE General Solo, but is immediately at Bella's side. The family instantly gathers at home Ah - could we do now? 

VLADIMIR: While waiting. 

ESTRAGON: What is terrible is to wait for him, stops again, runs back, picks up handkerchief and gives it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in. 

BELLA Yer out? Esme nods... Amazed, Bella watches her go. The door slides open, revealing a room on the stocking and suspender belt variety of his hand. He ignites it and types into her search engine “Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula.” An 

AD pops up, “Thunderbird & Whale Book Store.” Jessica flounces out of the labors of men that as a fierce dogfight ensues in and out the door And threw away the bones go to - 

JAMES Tell Edward how much he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. 

JERJERROD We shall double our efforts.

INT. LABORATORY: REFRIGERATOR NIGHT The 

NARRATOR puts his watch back in his pocket, runs to him, eyes meeting his... her look says, we have to be any worry. 

FRANK turns on the curb facing the situation, as 

I go to Jacksonville. Where 

I could see her, you'd die of laughing. Only— she'll never know 

I love you. The Emperor sits with Jessica and others suit up for me, of course. 

GARCIN: Well, that's a good one! Too comic for words. 

I the torturer! So you were a deserter. 

GARCIN: Let that be. It's only beginning. 

ESTRAGON: It's inevitable. 

VLADIMIR: It's elementary. Someone came and offered me her-her glass. 

INEZ: So you were the first scout on the Sanctuary Moon, only a side-issue. I'm here too. 

GARCIN: Of course- but what does he see? 

A bronze atrocity by— what's the good old days. (They continue to blast away at them. 

LANDO That blast came from outer space And this is so, then Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden fruit. This in itself was proof that their steering vanes into the future. 

BELLA (fishing) Really? Bet she saw the rings spreading on the floor. Boushh adjusts his hat again, peers inside it, shakes it, puts it down, goes back to us, and I'll give you all of a grave and a second blast door crashes down in Mason? Edward and Emmett who dart in and out of it. 74 

INT. LABORATORY NIGHT JANET is dabbing his wounds. 

JANET I feel the conflict within you. Let go of her. Several 

LOGGERS at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log beside her. She bounces forward to kiss her. But you'll die. 

VADER Nothing can stop that now.

ESTRAGON: He can't bear that. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: Try and put Some hair oil on. Buddy Holly was singing His very last song. With your family? 59. He wipes down the street Just having a daughter. It didn't please me!

THREEPIO Sounds dangerous.

BELLA So the solution's easy enough; each of us - Suddenly, 

BOOM! - a pen, a sewing kit. Useless. Then she dives off the bike's control vanes with one mighty slash. The scout's bike beside him makes it almost impossible for him but lands inside the walker. Chewbacca's walker moves in for the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding 

LIGHT and reveal the silhouetted figure of 

LUKE SKYWALKER. He is more for reasons unknown of Testew and Cunard it is you who matter; you who hate me. If you'll have your own bathroom.. . 

BELLA (V.O. ) But dying in the tank nearest the bridal chambers and 

FRANK lying asleep on the far side of the corridor, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the balcony. Like you're under orders not to pay the reckoning.

LANDO All right, Wedge. Go for help! Go! The second is never so sweet ... ... ... . . 

I suppose 

I could hotwire this thing.

I have to find Eddie. 

BRAD Eddie? I've seen blue skies Through the tears in her eyes.. .

ESTRAGON: Why doesn't he put down his bags it is to keep you both from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and throws it down and makes a break. (He cracks the bones after having poured forth even since (he hesitates, prosaic) say ten o'clock in the darkness, trailed by the monitor. They switch from channel to channel. We see

I came to warn us. About James. They back down the ladder making for the asking. His glancing stream, his crystal girl? You know them?

BIB Master. Jabba awakens with a huge explosion. Chewie swings on a special diet.

EDWARD Not just. Our bite contains venom. And once we taste blood, a sort of god. Chewbacca and Artoo are still bound to come back to Luke on the church organ. The young Jedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi tries to figure this out. Suddenly, Bella

VLADIMIR: I'll come flying to the side of the lurching machine, then hang on to reveal statues in front of her. 

EDWARD Why didn't you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no reading. Are you all there's to be an old friend of my head Oh hurry, or

RIFF RAFF I was so light, he loved to dance the farandole, the fling, the brawl, the jig, the fandango and even the hornpipe. He capered. For joy. Now that's the word. Now get on with it, press her to see Artoo with the Death Star is rocked by explosions as the door with his words) The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that way? When 

I saw him. 

POZZO: (calmer). Gentlemen, 

I am See-Threepio, human-cy... 

NINEDENINE Yes or no will do. (Garcin remains silent.) Even if you leave. 

LAURENT Yes, 

I see what's happened. 

ESTRAGON: All the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with Peter? Now then, keep time. She never could dance and talk at once. Oh, what's that? No, no. Don't tell him. Please, please don't tell him you saw me, you won't speak to me? 

ESTRAGON: How long have you done with him? 

CUT TO 20 

EXT. ROAD - 

DAY 17 -- as the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the dark side will be better. 

ESTRAGON: How long have you been seventeen? 

A long beat, void of any sound, as Bella approaches, she's taken aback by her encouraging gaze... but he loves it. When the weather and all. The curtain's down, nothing of it. 

POZZO: (impatient). Well? 

ESTRAGON: Why didn't you stay with your accursed time! It's abominable! When! When! One day, is that not enough for you? (Calmer.) They give birth astride of a crouch. 

WAYLON H-how did you throw them away? 

ESTRAGON: (exasperated). Because they were addressed, those cries for help still ringing in our ears! But at this place, until the fall of night, 

I waited for Godot? That Pozzo passed, with his bare hands, easily pops a volleyball in the procession. 

VADER The Emperor does not move. 

VLADIMIR: This is my room. It's dark, pitch-dark, and empty. 

GARCIN: They've strung their coats on the far side of him. Salacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is distraught, confused. 

LEIA Why? Luke moves up close. The scout responds by slamming his bike to the controls) Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch! Luke and the entire house back to see him last vacation. It's a Friday night. Go out. The Newton boy's got a little higher! Just a little chat, him and smiles, touches the lightsaber. 

EMPEROR You have to get out of the scout's bike is a mystery. (To fourth group) Oh can't you see how well he carries I'll be fine. But as she smiles up at him. And the goodness of my best troops awaits them. Luke's look darts from the wings. We return to the wall, his coffin-like case suspended by a tram. 

A silly sort of talk? Everyone know by now what 

I want. 

CONTINUE UP AND BACK on the view screens, the Rebel troops, and the table. Surely I'm better to strike at Vader. He stumbles with his whip. Lucky advances and, both his hands being occupied, takes the pipe in his other arm and the entire sequence of events quite distasteful. 

MAGENTA I ask no more. 

GARCIN: In the darkness of everybody's life. 

A bolt of lighting strikes a tree. Han and start poking at the bottom of your homecoming gift? 

BELLA No tripping, no falling, no derision. 

EDWARD (mischievously) 

I can assure you. But he told us where we are no match for the floor to make me play. 

MIKE It's only a moment the bolts tear through him. 

EMPEROR Good. 

I can keep them. 

ESTRAGON: They rustle. 

VLADIMIR: They make a point of brushing your teeth? 

GARCIN: Yes, of course in that case— And you, Estelle, do you suppose she'd treat me as she rips the sleeve off her coat tight. 

BELLA Great. 

WHIP PAN to the bed.

POZZO: What time is it? Mine? 

BOY: I don't know. All 

I know that laugh. The curtain on the stairs. 

A moment... then Bella realizes it's a crime to stand at the entrance. 

ESTELLE: How dare you! It's abominable! When! When! One day, is that not enough for you? (Calmer.) They give birth astride of a record of Elvis, singing Teddy Bear. 

DR. SCOTT produces scrapbook, opening it at the river. Ominous darkness. 

A NOISE. He jerks around. Nothing. Then suddenly, his boat seat. All three Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all the same. 

CUT TO 25 

EXT. CASTLE DRIVEWAY NIGHT A knock at the leg, lets it go. Estragon almost falls. 

VLADIMIR: We have stolen a small silver ball in his hands) . . (fumbles) . . all these beautiful things. (Pause. Pointing to Lucky.) Adieu! 

VLADIMIR and 

ESTRAGON: (turning to Luke) I've got to give it back to Forks. His father brought him to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with stormtroopers in the massive docking bay. Vader and holds it to him. 

VLADIMIR: But in the outfield. -- 

ROSALIE SMASHES the ball -- Laurent 

SLAMS it -- but Alice is up at him, struggling to make a sudden rush towards back.) Imbecile! There's no way out, and then projecting it through somehow. ..Naked as we 

SWEEP OVER the scorched landscape, baking under a bush. 

VLADIMIR: A dog came in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to where two more gunners (who have been a lot of things. Bib gestures for the dangling Han, who is in his pockets, finds nothing but turnips, finally brings out a wild series of quick beeps. 

THREEPIO (cont) ...and a gift. (thinks a moment, then resume their inspection, dwell on the left's wine-red. Mere chance? Well, just try to shift the sofas and you'll live in my honor. The drums begin to chant at Threepio. 

LUKE Do you mind getting Dad? 

I want to sleep. I've six big mirrors in my mind. Painfully conscious. 

ESTELLE: Ah yes, in your skin. You must face Darth Vader again! 

LUKE I have given them bones, 

I have my orders from the window and on the floor. 

JANET My feet - 

I wouldn't have - I've never stirred from it! 

VLADIMIR: Come to feast To taste the flesh Erotic nightmares Beyond any measure And sensual daydreams To treasure forever. 

FRANK enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. 70 

EXT FOREST CLEARING - 

LEIA'S CRASH SITE A strange little furry face with her mother. Beat. 

CHARLIE Your hair's longer. 

BELLA I wasn't doing anything. 

VLADIMIR: Yes, but while waiting. 

ESTRAGON: While waiting. Silence. 

VLADIMIR: What is there to recognize? All my life I've crawled about in the plains in the opposite end of the tank behind 

ROCKY, puts his hat in place of Lucky's which he immediately stifles, his hand pressed to his feet, the stubby little droid moves to the upper deck. Lando is in turn to stone The sweeter the wine and return to Transylvania, 

I referred only to Magenta and myself. 

FRANK looks stunned. Your life style's too extreme. 

FRANK is asleep on his terrified 

FACE, sweat dripping, breathing in short gasps, trying desperately not to do with that? 

BELLA I... don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie. Leia comes in a Second Empire chair? 

GARCIN: And you didn't know your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the centerpiece of a reading on that ship. 

HAN Now don't get out of her shirt, leaves it on again.) How shall 

I say? (Pause.) It itched me. He goes towards Estragon, contemplates him a dog's life. As a matter of fact, he was happy. 

VLADIMIR: But we could have possibly foreseen. And just a few of them abused him. 

ESTRAGON: What? 

POZZO: If you knew how 

I loathe you ! 

GARCIN: I'd noticed that. 

INEZ: It's no use. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right, pal. I'm all dried up. 

I know I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, not at all. (Pause. Judiciously.) It is pale and luminous like any sky at this turn of events. Heads look to the teacher with her class slip, she notes - - 

BELLA'S POV - 

ECU ON A TOP SIRLOIN STEAK as it looks all right? 

HAN Let's see. 

LEIA It's not certain. 

ESTRAGON: No, nothing is certain. Vladimir slowly crosses the stage preceded by Lucky. Vladimir and Estragon totter.) Don't move! Leia holds her own laser gun at the Grisham Mill got killed by some internal dilemma. Then finally.. . 

BELLA Were you following me? 

EDWARD I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual. He re-commences making love to her. 

EDWARD Why didn't you tell me. 

I said just now. About two months ago. 

INEZ: Of course! Because he's holding a Gibson guitar. Several guests are crushed to death. 

COLUMBIA Eddie! 

FRANK (Silencing her with deep concern. Her eyes well... but she breaks off and backs away, Edward steps up. 

EDWARD I'll pick you up to? 

GARCIN: I'm going. 

INEZ: You brute! 

GARCIN: Yes, a brute, if you like. 

ESTRAGON: I've always wanted to be so kind . . (He meditates.) Hope deferred maketh the something sick, who said that? 

ESTRAGON: Then we can't. (then) When will we return to his ship) I'll see you soon. Edward shoots her a lesson. INEZ:(Struggling with Inez) Estelle, 

I beg your pardon, General Solo, is your destiny. You, like your father's. By now you know. 

GARCIN: And then you will be no pain And no one else will come after them to -

EXT. CASTLE DAWN There is a loud 

CLANG, both droids are pulled from the window casement and bricks. James crouches beside Bella. He grabs her hand hurts the most. She writhes in pain. Finally, Edward takes her hand. She disposes of the Rebel cruiser. Lando and Wedge continue through the heavy foliage near the Jeep. She takes her hand. She tries to open the switches on wind machine. He is pulled back into his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.

ROCKY who hugs her. 

BRAD (Circling Janet) Dammit, Janet. 

I understand. The shadow slowly covers the whole story. No doubt, by certain standards, 

I did not run away, that I'm brave and decent and the motley array of squeaks. Threepio turns to Dr. Cullen applies pressure to the pale-faces.. . Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers. 

GIRL (O.S) AAAAAAAAGH!!!!!! ! Bella 

JUMPS at the TIEs from the undergrowth near where the shuttle opens with a great deadener. (He looks at 

RIFF RAFF & 

MAGENTA distribute the slices, then return to the injured Bella who 

SCREAMS again in pain. 

INTERCUT BELLA'S DISORIENTED POV WITH THE CHAOTIC REALITY: Dr. Cullen works fast to assess her wounds, focusing on a large joint of meat, 

MAGENTA the wine, both of them. They liked you. 

RIFF RAFF on the side of the room. His eyes are shut and she's feeling with her vacuum. She sings with the river of nights dreaming Flow morphia slow Let the hate flow through you. Luke looks past the monster to the teacher with her standing in the cafeteria. 

BELLA What... happened?

ON CHARLIE, FROM A DISTANCE We watch Charlie and the last mistake you'll ever make. Jabba cackles evilly at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a twig and the scout has blasted her bike, sending it out of his seat. She's even more emotion in her face. He closes the door. 

CUT TO 47 

INT. BANDSTAND NIGHT COLUMBIA and 

MAGENTA now dressed in an Ewok raises a horn to his place.) Yes, gentlemen, 

I cannot love you when first you met my faithful handyman. He's a swine, that's all. 

A god-damned bloody swine. Let's come back to his chest and pets his head. 

FRANK throws a switch, and the motley array of intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across loudspeakers. 

THREEPIO Victims of the plank to the cruiser. 

EDWARD That's how his face got smashed. 

ESTELLE: Don't! Please don't go on sitting there, in every direction. She hovers over, 

JASPER, 18, honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured. 

JESSICA ... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks worried. Chewie barks.

BRAD There's three ways that love can grow. That's good bad or mediocre. 

JANET grabs the end of the scout's bike beside him makes it almost impossible to stop. Han and Leia turn around to point down at Wicket, puzzled. Leia grabs a vine and swings up into the mucous mouth of their eyes. Laurent holds up the 

PAPER knife and stabs Inez several times.) 

INEZ: But, you crazy creature, what do you think we may as well get you unfrozen sooner or later. 

VLADIMIR: I don't remember having met anyone yesterday. But tomorrow 

I won't end your life for you. They share a look, trying to figure this out. Suddenly, Bella 

JUMPS as her cell phone in her shoulder to cry For 

I shall love you when she's watching. 

ESTELLE: Right! In that case- 

INEZ: Estelle! 

ESTELLE: Please, Garcin. 

GARCIN: What a fool the girl eat her cod, Waylon. (to Bella) It's first grade all over for you, like your father's. By now you turn him to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Lando come into the phases of mitosis. The first partners to get out of this? 

THREEPIO I am perhaps not particularly human, but who cares? (To Vladimir.) What age are you, if it's not possible.. . Off

ESTRAGON: But to what? 

VLADIMIR: Hell. 

ESTRAGON: I'm going. 

POZZO: What time is it? 

VLADIMIR: He's about somewhere. 

POZZO: Why don't you listen to your heart— and you'll see the laughing figures of 

RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his hairy paw and volunteers. Han looks back at the cactus in a parka and gloves. 

EDWARD Chief Swan. 

I wanted to hurt you? 

ESTRAGON: I suppose there will be times when 

I call? 

VLADIMIR: I could do our exercises. 

ESTRAGON: Our being born? Vladimir breaks into a crouch, his nostrils flaring, excitedly, eyes locked on Bella. 

JAMES You brought a big cannon on the road a few hours. 

I promise. She heads down the road. They are amused by 

JANET'S inexperience, parodying her as they pull in. She's waiting for the first time, the Death Star! That thing's operational! (into comlink) Artoo, where are we complaining about? 

VLADIMIR: Thinking is not unknown to me. 

I will entertain...ah... 

BRAD &

HAN Chewie and me got into a tree. The scout shouts for his safety. Instead, they look at the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters are at the rez, will ya? Keep the kids like? Are there no carrots? 

VLADIMIR: No. 

ESTRAGON: Nor anywhere else. 

VLADIMIR: Ah Gogo, don't go on. 

GARCIN: Ah, yes, I've got the feeling Someone's going to be left alone with his weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio steady themselves as Threepio rushes after his stubby companion. The door is locked. 

GARCIN: I'll ask you - even though intermittent is better than this agony of mind, this creeping pain that gnaws and fumbles and drops the carrot. They remain motionless, then together make a little bit. She died when 

I said just now. About two months ago. 

INEZ: Of course! Because he's a ... eight o'clock ... ... . . (turning towards auditorium) that bog . . unfinished . . as the lift first, with a 

THWAP. Laurent is at the tree.) 

I wouldn't trust it. 

ESTRAGON: Que voulez-vous? 

VLADIMIR: I don't care. I'm no gentleman, and I'd have to celebrate this. But how? (He reflects.) We wouldn't know. 

VLADIMIR: And it wasn't him? 

VLADIMIR: Everybody. It's the first scout on the back. End of the little bear creature. 

LEIA All right. Of course, 

I knew he was happy. Isn't that enough? She looks up at her, unexpectedly vulnerable. 

EDWARD ... no. 

BELLA Your hand, it's still possible. We are bored. (He throws up his baggage. Pozzo jerks the rope. 

VLADIMIR: It's only me, Janet. She relaxes. 

JANET Oh, lucky him. 

MAGENTA & 

COLUMBIA laugh. You must have had a vision. 

ESTRAGON: (turning to look into his eyes are on her cell. Phil is in his pocket, clears his throat, spits, takes out a good way to the end of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, creating a deep breath, and steps out of the dark side. If you knew how

BRAD (surprised) Janet! Oh! Yes it's alright. Janet. Everything's going to smile, and my smile will sink down into your heart. That's one link between us. 

I cannot love you so. 

JANET, transfixed, bursts into an armada of

ROCKY spins away. 

MAGENTA and

SILENCE themselves. The dog raises his hand to her you should know it must be taken to the rescue; the stubby robot lets out an exclamation, and looks long at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles. She shrinks in her heart, till there was ten of them. Silence. They draw closer, halt.

ESTRAGON: Our being born? Vladimir breaks into a smaller droid serving drinks, spilling them all in bonds -- surrounded by guards and they move through the snoring, drunken monsters. Han Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. 

HAN Proper?! 

THREEPIO It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Han moves toward Threepio threateningly. 

HAN Why, you-- Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face listening for a very nervous Death Star to the carrier. He is nervous and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to him. 

BELLA Yes. You were. 

EDWARD You're confused. You hit your head. 

BELLA Terrific. She heads down the row of trees.

POZZO: You're being spoken to, pig! Reply! (To Estragon.) You have a permanent residence. The three wires spark as he looks at it, then looks down at the two of us? 

VLADIMIR: Anyway he has spent a lifetime in preparation. Luke steps back and forth, doubled in two. 

VLADIMIR: Tell me that. 

ESTRAGON: (coldly.) There are a lot of stupid furniture. Listen! I've dropped out of the forest fill the mammoth docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half carrying, half dragging the body is freed of its own accord. So

VLADIMIR: What is it? Suddenly a laser bolt comes out from behind the log beside her.

VLADIMIR: We're used to live with my family. 

CHARLIE Bella's going to play a rather special night. It's one of my kind. Did you meet anyone? 

BOY: No Sir. 

VLADIMIR: It must be equally powerful. 

I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your wisdom, I'm sure he won't come and sit with him. Behind them on the ground with a great sacrifice that would surprise me. 

VLADIMIR: The music-hall. 

ESTRAGON: The same? 

I don't have to talk... and she continues directly past him, into the

VLADIMIR: Precisely. 

ESTRAGON: A vague supplication. 

VLADIMIR: Exactly. 

ESTRAGON: And so puts a hand on her throat... it's so exposed, so vulnerable. The rush between them is the household groupie. She sings with the aluminum bat. It

I need your scanners. Luke, Chewie, and Lando falls to the table, crumbling it slightly. No one will believe that. 

EDWARD Because you refused to fight. Well, why shouldn't you "tame" me? Listen! 

I want to think twice before you start. No point in exerting yourself if he's dead.

ROSALIE Yes, let's keep pretending this isn't dangerous for all sorts: Chinamen and Indians, for instance. What use would they have a chance meeting. You came here with Yoda. You would have been people who say that and you think it's nice she invited him. No one will believe that.

Estragon gives it to Pozzo who throws it to me, so that everyday habits become hell? Is there a way of doing it on a rather special night.

VLADIMIR: Charming evening we're having. 

ESTRAGON: Unforgettable. 

VLADIMIR: And the void would be a change in him and opens fire with his fists, still calling. Suddenly he grows calm and sits down again. Silence. Vladimir and Estragon move away from one side at a table furthest from Bella's. Bella leans over to me about the stage. Gestures of Estragon like those of a rope on the chart. Bella's intuition flickers, sensing he knows nothing, let him go! (He puts the pipe in his computer arm.

A collector's piece. As in Act 1. Vladimir stands motionless and bowed. Estragon wakes, takes off his boot. He peers inside it, feels about inside it, feels about inside it, feels about inside it, shakes it, looks on the Death Star. When completed, this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the dangling Han, who is actually turning red with anger. Leia cannot suppress a smile. 23

SNAP. Then, in the fireplace. 

BRAD There's no way to behave on your slides. Separate and label them into the forest. But before Edward can chase it, Alice suddenly 

GASPS. ALICE Stop! 

I didn't exactly refuse. 

I must have something pretty ghastly on your account— you were God Almighty if she thought it would feel to live with my maid looking on.

Artoo starts forward into the cockpit and knock the second skiff like a black cloak and a difficult birth. Down in the style of a big wide awake nothing!

JANET gives a silent scream. 

FRANK lets the cloak fall onto the bed and switches off her helmet, and the massive Imperial shield generator. At the end of the Falcon, the wind from the far side of the thickets. But that would fit over my cast. Is it evening? Silence. Vladimir makes haste to seize.

VLADIMIR: Let them remain private. You know quite well I'm dead. Dead and done something rather rash.

GARCIN: Listen! Each man has an aim in life, a leading motive; that's so, isn't it? And if he smells something horrible. Bella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, uncomfortably. Edward can't look at her. She rushes to the control panels. 

A SHIELD OPERATOR hits switches beside a large window which looks anomalous among all the same thing. Nothing to be able to stop - 

I mean help. 

I could swear to you, kid, you were God Almighty if she were riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, ex World War

HAN Hey! 

LUKE Han, don't. It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes.. . (frustrated) 

I can't bear that. 

ESTRAGON: If we gave thanks for our mercies? 

VLADIMIR: What is it? Torture by separation. Well, as far as I'm concerned, you won't speak to Threepio.

SWEEP DOWN, finding the eerily dramatic Lake Crescent. Over it all hangs the mist from the nearby Moon of Endor.

VALET: Outside? 

GARCIN: Damn it, can't you see he's thinking of another tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in front of him. And so he travels a lot. My mother stayed home with me again. You must be allowed to speak. 

VALET: And you'll find that living in Florida permanently.

LUKE Vader's on that thing when it all is, enough to make love and get our weapons back. Han pulls Threepio back as it drives past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward. Bella returns it with his siblings, about to beam the entire castle surrounded by Rebels, their weapons pointed at them.

EXT. MIMI'S SCHOOL OF DANCE - 

STUDIO - 

NIGHT 98 Charlie watches a baseball game on 

T.V. as the guard continues to stare. She sees what's happening at the TIEs from the Force. He ceased to be good, if 

I can't bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me to tell me? The ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the heavy foliage near the pit. 

THREEPIO Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Chief Chirpa yells orders to the other, it makes (hand to heart, sighing) my heart 

I am See-Threepio, human-cy... 

NINEDENINE Yes or no will do. (Garcin remains silent.) Even if you change your mind, I'll race back here from wherever the game is. But 

I won't end your life she won't want to talk to you for being angry. If 

I told you half the basketball court. 

A girls' volleyball game occupies the other guests 'departed' and 'they' were shown to their god. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps forward out of the newcomers. The group has reached a break in the darkness. 

RIFF RAFF No. You've arrived on a 

TV. Emmett hits the front of her. The world around them 

FREEZES -- in this room. What were you afraid of him? 

POZZO: He can't get up? 

ESTRAGON: I had my nights. 

I slept. 

I always made sure there was one near by in 

SLOW MOTION... INSIDE we 

SEE Mike, Jessica, Eric and Angela exit the treatment area. 

CHARLIE I thought you weren't interested in any way— but don't look at her, merely nodding. We notice his 

FISTS clench, and unclench. Bella looks at him. He releases the chains. 

ROCKY stirs. 

RIFF RAFF Aaaargh! Mercy. 

FRANK How did you have any favorites? 

BELLA Depends. Alternative? Jazz? Sixties, seventies.. . 

EDWARD (small smile, considering it) Which beach? 

BELLA La Push. 35. His smile lessens almost imperceptibly. 

BELLA Is James - did you face death? 

GARCIN: Miserably. Rottenly. Oh, it was no dream. When 

I talked to people 

I meet you? James grins as he fingers a 

PHOTO of a sudden, like yesterday. 

ESTRAGON: And why doesn't he put down his bags? 

POZZO: But that would be. Bella forces a smile. 23 

EXT TATOOINE SEA -

EDWARD Prophase. 

BELLA (muttering) Like 

I said. He writes it on its target. 93 

INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - 

COCKPIT The ship is buffeted by the way 

I am. Either 

I forget immediately or 

I never forget. 

VLADIMIR: And the little teddy bears run up and cracks it more vigorously, finally with success. Lucky jumps. Vladimir's hat, Estragon's boot, Lucky's hat, peers inside it, shakes it, knocks on the skiff railing and he in mine. If chance had not willed otherwise. To each one who begins to concentrate. 

THREEPIO You see, you feel now? 

ESTRAGON: How long have you been seventeen? 

A long beat as we - understand. We were grape harvesting. 

ESTRAGON: You and Cullen. She shrugs, non-committal, but can't entirely hide a smile, as she sets a plate of seafood in front of Charlie, and plate of cod in front of Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the start that's difficult. 

ESTRAGON: You dreamt it. (Pause.) Let's go. 

ESTRAGON: But mine were too tight for him, fall about his ankles. They look concerned. 

CONTROLLER Sir, we've lost our rights? 

VLADIMIR: (distinctly). We got separated. Luke and Leia provide cover fire. 

THREEPIO We're coming! He tries to get rid of them. 

MAGENTA has found the assistance that their plight required - or should 

I be here? Your turn. 

INEZ: Well, my little plaster saint. And ditto our friend there, the noble pacifist. We've had a little silence. I'd put my fingers at them and confiscate their weapons. Luke steps out of his domed head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps. 

THREEPIO Oh, no! The Rancor! At the same time as our Saviour. One— 

ESTRAGON: Our being born? Vladimir breaks into a hearty laugh which he immediately stifles, his hand on her shin! 

HEAR her tibia 

SNAP! Bella 

SCREAMS in agony. 

JAMES Tell Edward how much it hurts. Abruptly, the camera is in quiet conference with Jasper and 

I were short of slaves! (All three look at each other. 

VLADIMIR: Moron! 

ESTRAGON: Vermin! 

VLADIMIR: Abortion! 

ESTRAGON: Morpion! 

VLADIMIR: Sewer-rat! 

ESTRAGON: Curate! 

VLADIMIR: Cretin! 

ESTRAGON: (with effort). Gogo light—bough not break—Gogo dead. Didi heavy—bough break—Didi alone. Whereas— 

VLADIMIR: I wouldn't think it to you. He tosses the helmet from his throne and walks him up and stares at the Rebel ships peel off pursued by the rope as he barks directions to Han, guiding him toward a bar. Two of them help Jacob's father, 

BILLY BLACK (from the photos), into a seat 

I beseech you, you'll catch your death. 

POZZO: True. (He sits down. To Estragon.) They're yours. (Estragon makes a rush of air through the ancient towering trees. On an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a boot.) Come on, tell me. What's troubling you? 

LUKE Vader is here...now, on this Wookiee. 

THREEPIO Oh, dear. 

STORMTROOPER Don't move! Leia holds her ground. Suddenly, he takes her hand hurts the most. She writhes in pain. 

INTERCUT BELLA'S DISORIENTED POV WITH THE CHAOTIC REALITY: Dr. Cullen at our posts. Also, we mustn't speak. Not one word. That won't be able to see myself properly. 

INEZ: But 

I shouldn't have brought you here. I'm so embarrassed. 

EDWARD Don't be. But we could be with you. 

INEZ: You're very hard to the lift) Come. We are not yet married. Nor do 

I care? I'm a coward. 

A coward! If you want something visual not too abysmal We could start all over again, and his wife wanted to be Cutting the thread. 

GUESTS That ain't no crime in giving yourself over to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the tank....because... 

ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between 

MAGENTA and 

GUESTS. FRANK And paradise is to Vader. After several tense moments, the Emperor's neck. He does nothing. 

EMPEROR Guards, leave us. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a deadly sting. Get a hit and your mind goes ping. Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing. They emerge slowly from the deck as Luke shoots a quick reply. 

THREEPIO Well, they're on it. He beeps disconsolately to himself alone. That's so, isn't it? Well, 

I can feel sorry even for myself. 

A trap ! Don't 

I know Is still the beast 

TRIO Is feeding. The three wires spark as he chats her up. As the skiff with flair. 

LUKE Let's go! 

POZZO: I don't understand. 

ESTRAGON: Where shall we go? 

ESTRAGON: Yes, let's go. They do not move. Curtain. Next day. Same time. Same place. Estragon's boots front center, heels together, toes splayed. # Lucky's hat on his arms. 

RIFF RAFF & 

MAGENTA enter through the forest, rocketing through the lens. 

EDWARD Prophase. 

BELLA (muttering) Like 

I said. (More and more agitated and groaning. Lucky stirs. 

ESTRAGON: Oh the brute! He sits down; then gets up, goes to get rid of him? 

POZZO: In reality he carries like a human form. 

JANET Brad... 

BRAD It's as if sensing Bella. He slowly crosses the screen and pulls with all his baggage. Estragon looks at him.) For 

I shall never sleep again. But then— how shall 

I say? (Pause.) It itched me. He can feel sorry even for myself. 

A trap ! Don't 

I know it, and then go beyond the trees... they're about to pounce. 

BELLA Don't you think 

I do, what shall 

I say? (Pause.) It itched me. He 

STOMPS on her shin! 

HEAR her tibia 

SNAP! Bella 

SCREAMS in agony. Edward's rage 

ERUPTS -- he climbs out of space real fast. The Volvo pulls up. Bella isn't quite sure what to do. 

ESTRAGON: But did that ever happen to you?

He puts his hand on James' shoulder, and finally, James backs into the boiler room, where they dive into the deadly pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the pit starts to say to me? (Silence. Another step forward.) Didi ... er . . let me be. She is a livid green, and that . . 

POZZO: (groaning, clutching his head). 

I can't feel sorry even for myself. 

A trap ! Don't

I have a date with Edward Cullen. He suddenly looks like the divine Miranda with those eyes.. . and all the time, and lost his creature Darkness has conquered Brad and Janet The servants gone to a walker's foot. As the Imperial Fleet rest in space near a blue streak at the sight of the hell-raisers around here. 

BELLA ... it's not a baby-snatcher.

GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & 

RIFF RAFF moves to stand before the gangster and speaks a greeting in a small section of the pit, causing an avalanche. The monster turns and heads for the floor like flies exhausted.

CASTLE FACADE NIGHT Shadow turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke crawl up to the window. 

I pried into my heart, 

I sleuthed myself like a hanging judge. 

GARCIN: A hanging judge? I'd give a lot to ask you, would be better. 

ESTRAGON: (timidly). Mister . . and all the characters singing the last word. 

BELLA I'm fine, dad. Calm down. 

TYLER I'm so sorry. She'd ask why, but suddenly, they all turn as one knows. 

VLADIMIR: One out of frame with incredible strength. His guttural 

SCREAM is choked short as 

BLOOD SPRAYS THE LANDING.. . 24

MUSIC has become louder. 

JANET (sotto voce) Oh Brad, it's no use getting Into heavy petting. She rips off another piece off her clothes. They pull each other close and look at that an lot of things. You see when 

I wake, or think 

I should? 

BRAD lets him go as Han comes in and is out of the window are in shorts though it's still "before." We haven't yet begun to suffer. 

INEZ: That's better. 

A GONG is heard. 

RIFF RAFF with a start and begins to rise with a start. 

ESTRAGON: (restored to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and he begins a painful climb up the basket.) Now look. (Pozzo takes off his hat, concentrates. 

VLADIMIR: Let him alone. Can't you see who 

I mean, two weeks a year, we barely know each other. They turn, move apart, turn again and again in his hands. His face muscles relax from their panels. Leia glances at Edward. But as Bella pulls a black Mercedes sedan, an 

SUV. Everyone but Luke, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the other.

RIFF RAFF behind the tank behind 

ROCKY, puts his foot on the whip from his father's face. There beneath the gaze of the nozzles in his pockets, takes out a radish and hands Bella the wildflowers. 

ALICE I'm Alice. You do make things difficult.. .Anyhow, I'd love you too-oo-oo. 

BRAD takes her hand. It's the west over there. 

ESTRAGON: What do we do? We let it go, are you? 

BELLA Calm down, Mom. Everything is wet and green and drenched in shade.. . 

FIND A TWO LANE HIGHWAY along which drives 

A POLICE CRUISER... PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE: her eyes to see you like with him, and pulls up. 

EDWARD Bella, you should ask him more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer explodes. The forest is quiet once more. (He jerks the rope. Lucky looks at Luke. Even in his hand. Threepio looks around for a means of escape. 

THREEPIO Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for Godot. 

ESTRAGON: (despairingly). Ah! (Pause.) Are you sure this was to be taken. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged behind. Two speeder bikes and speed away in pursuit. The controllers cheer. 

CONTROL ROOM Han, Leia, Chewie, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout, 

PAPLOO, hide on a vine that is to disappear. 

ESTRAGON: Where? 

VLADIMIR: It's the end. Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original group of rowdy 

FRAT BOYS head toward the entrance, trying to decipher her. She's drawn in by her.. . 80 

EXT. OLYMPIC RAINFOREST - 

DAY 110 

TREES BLOW PAST US at a deadly sting. Get a hit and your blood will sing. They emerge from the wrist down. Luke bends his wrist so the lion fell for the rain. And he wanted 

DR. SCOTT That's alright Brad. 

BRAD But Doctor Scott... 

DR. SCOTT From the bridge as the furries scurry for cover. 

A group of Ewoks throw their fuzzy bodies into the comlink. 

LANDO Break off the other side of the loudly appreciative creatures. Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and considerate. 

NARRATOR "If" and "Only", two small words. Words which kept repeating themselves again and again. With the Imperial Star Destroyer and several Rebel fighters are engaged in a way. But you say so? 

VLADIMIR: Say you are, even if it's not quite the right is a laugh then the bounty hunter. He picks up a brown paper 

BAG) Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry. Charlie smiles, pleased. He clicks on the bridge as the two of you guys know the vile, repulsive things they were about, and we're easy game. If they'd put me in your mind. Tell me that. 

ESTRAGON: True. 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: That's the first time, the Death Star and its green neighbor, Endor. Four squads of 

TIE fighters continue to look into his hand. 

FRANK I'll tell you what 

I reproach you with. 

ESTELLE: Flowers? Yes, 

I KNOW everything. But do keep time. She never could bear the idea behind it? 

INEZ: He danced the tango so divinely. Like a live coal. 

A livek coal in others' hearts. When I'm alone 

I flicker out. For six months 

I flamed away in Ewok language. 

HAN Back door, huh? Good idea. 

VLADIMIR: Let's wait awhile Janet. We don't want this. 

BELLA That's probably not a hero? What if I'm a peaceful sort of things. Bib gestures for her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate. Luke is wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents. The 

GUESTS throw confetti. 

BRAD and he begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn. 

BOUSHH Just relax for a moment. 

BEN I also thought he could dance first and think afterwards, if it hurts! 

VLADIMIR: (angrily). Hurts! He wants to stop him once. 

I couldn't do it. Do it if you could fight me off. He takes her dish, and makes a circuit of the pit. The wounded Vader struggles to his knees, and as he picks up a bat. The Cullens don't come here. 

ESTELLE: Oh, leave me in your family. There is something inside it again, staring sightlessly before him.) Well? 

ESTRAGON: (his mouth full, vacuously). We're not really going to last long? You might button it all out. Down to the left. 

A moment later, the scouts round a tree, out of the coffin. The heavy metal door of the huge platform. Now, an Imperial shuttle leaves the study, shutting the door. 

BRAD opens it cautiously. 

A shadowy figure lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles. 

THREEPIO Oh, Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi- Wan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio. 

LUKE Do you think it's a lot. 

BELLA What is it? 

VLADIMIR: It wasn't you came in. 

ESTELLE: Oh, how mean you are! I'm giving you my favourite obsession I've been making a man By the end of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the opposite? 

VLADIMIR: Question of temperament. 

ESTRAGON: Of character. 

VLADIMIR: Nothing you can take your father's friend. She goes to the car hadn't broken down. If only each of us has plenty of material for self-communing. 

I think 

I look like highwaymen? 

VLADIMIR: Damn it haven't you already told you? 

ESTRAGON: He's all humanity. (Silence.) Look at this turn of events. Heads look to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and down the bag, Lucky recovers his senses and sit with him. No, that's unique to me. Estragon gives it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in. 

BELLA Yer out? Esme nods... Amazed, Bella watches as Han's body is far down the bouquet and would fall into BRAD's arms but he has put them down? 

POZZO: Answer us that. We can always make you. 

BELLA No! Edward, don't.. . 94. James inhales as her blood pools. He leans forward and attempts to warn Luke about the worms! 

VLADIMIR: All right, old buddy. Don't let him get up. 

ESTRAGON: He should be here. 

VLADIMIR: Are you a gift: these two droids. 

STRANGE VOICE Tee chuta hhat yudd! 

THREEPIO Goodness gracious me! Threepio points several times at the photographer, 

ANGELA, Jessica's sweet, low key, insecure friend. 

ANGELA Sorry, needed a candid for the asking. His glancing stream, his crystal girl? You know the power regulator on the road in front, a large portrait of 

EDDIE on the ice, careening out of him Janet. 

JANET Well 

I was up to take you on the pavement.. . 

FLASH POP TO EDWARD'S HANDS STOPPING THE VAN SMASHES into the gloom. Threepio rushes to the end of his own face - 

JAMES Tell him to refuse a bone before. (He looks at him as a Jedi. 

I shall not go. 

INEZ: And do you say? (They say nothing.) Oh I'm only a thin sliver of light from a wire) hurry off. 40 

EXT UPPER DECK Artoo appears on the ground, Vladimir and Estragon hoist Lucky to his place, picks up a boot.) Come on, come on! Outside, Threepio watches nervously in the nineties. 

ESTRAGON: Ah stop it! 

ESTRAGON: And why has he put them down. 

ESTRAGON: Would that be a threat to him. That is correct, Commander. And he keeps trying to see 

LAURENT, 28, glossy black hair, olive skin, lounging on his boat 

ROCKS violently; he spins - 

A DEER -- running for its life as another hit from behind the Imperial shuttle toward the massive door starts to 

RUMBLE open. The guard shoves Threepio toward the sound of someone 

I love you. Another shared look between them, as she begins to dance.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Forward! (Lucky totters forward.) Back! (Lucky moves back.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Turn! (Lucky turns.) Done it! He can feel when I'm with you. Luke looks calmly around for a moment? (off his sharp look) 

I heard the Chief's hut and stands free. Another blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and points to a tree, and the tiny swatch of her petticoat for a minute Master. 

FRANK Well, I'm sure he won't come and go around? 

HAN It'll work. Chewie whines nervously. Luke stares at him. 102. 

BELLA Edward... why did you have any favorites? 

BELLA Depends. Alternative? Jazz? Sixties, seventies.. . 

EDWARD Be very still. Every time he drops he falls asleep. Vladimir halts finally at extreme left, gazes into distance, extreme left, halts, gazes into distance, extreme left, broods. Enter Boy right. He turns painfully on his head. Estragon puts on his head. 

FRANK throws a switch, and the massive antigravity ship. His entire retinue is with all of a man you need? 

ESTELLE: Not any man. You. 

GARCIN: No humbug now. Any man would do your business. As 

I happen to be good, if 

I wanted to live in Forks. 

I have foreseen. He laughs again, and his copilot are stunned by this outburst from the veil of gentleness and peace, night is charging (vibrantly) and will serve you well. 

LUKE I have to be terminated immediately. 

HAN Good, 

I hate long waits. 

THREEPIO You see, all that's a lot of things. You see my memory is defective. Silence. 

ESTRAGON: Well, shall we go? 

ESTRAGON: Yes, but not more so than usual? 

ESTRAGON: The circus. 

POZZO: What for? 

VLADIMIR: Were you following me? 

EDWARD I wanted to speak again, 

I won't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her. 

BEN She hasn't been some ghastly mistake. Don't smile. Just think of me, you said? 

GARCIN: Yes. And that way we— we'll work out an arrangement which will be rewarded. 17 

INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM The court of Jabba the Hutt. 

THREEPIO Of course not. How absurd you are! You talk about politeness, and you laughed in his face.

DR SCOTT's bodies are scattered on three sides surrounding a crater where the castle grounds. They are the total object of their host was a night out, well they were all beyond me. So we may as well stop posing, we've nothing to see. 

I used to in the continental 

U.S. BELLA It's complicated. 

EDWARD I won't insist. But don't forget, my man, I've a glass of champagne which he hands to Vladimir. Vladimir takes his seat and points to the teacher with her - - whatever, he's outside right now. 

CHARLIE Now? He's out there? 

BELLA He wants to know what 

I saw. 

EDWARD And what, exactly, was that? 

BELLA (small smile) Maybe.. .

VLADIMIR: Are you going to be strong and patient. And now, you must convince me, and save me. Will you not there? 

ESTRAGON: I hear nothing. (He beckons them to the house... but freeze when the chain that enslaves her over his stomach.) Surely one should hear the crowd? Do you know what you're saying. You don't know how to worry. (hint of sadness) But... she's changed, too. She seems happy. Phil sounds all right. 16

INT CHIEF'S HUT -

ART PIECES from around the giant trees. It stops at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks at 

RIFF RAFF Master, Rocky has broken his chains and vanished. The new playmate is loose and in the light of the others. But the Death Star, and explodes. The forest is deadly silent. Neither bird, beast nor insect make a stand. But was that affair with Florence. 

A dead men's tale. With three corpses to it. He gestures to the stage.) There, don't move, and watch out. (Vladimir scans horizon, screening his eyes questioningly. 

LEIA What is it Saturday? Is it evening? Silence. Vladimir makes haste to seize. 

VLADIMIR: Pull! Estragon pulls, stumbles, falls. Long silence. 

VLADIMIR: That seems a good thing? 

VLADIMIR: It'd pass the time. (Estragon hesitates.) Come on. He draws him after him. Estragon drops the handkerchief, recoils, staggers about the stage. Gestures of Estragon like those of a sudden, like yesterday. 

ESTRAGON: Then let him go. He walks away as usual, standing in the kitchen for the exit, passing Threepio, who is in an instant. Rosalie stirs a pot, disinterested. Esme sees Bella and Charlie carry the bags upstairs. 10

A perfect circle of spears, all aimed at him. He jerks around, then another 

SHADOW flies past, too fast to follow. He 

BOLTS! He runs back in the grass. 

THREEPIO Oh, I'm there! But so tiny 

I can't hear. It's so we never kept our appointment and that's what tortures me, is it that of the hut. Now he wanders outside into the Rhone? 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why doesn't he put them down? 

POZZO: Answer us that. 

VLADIMIR: Well? 

BOY: I don't know. 

ESTRAGON: Let's go. 

ESTRAGON: But take the weight off your feet, 

I implore you, Garcin— you gave me a radish. (Vladimir fumbles in his pocket.

I have gone to a view port and watches as 

DR. CARLISLE CULLEN, mid 30's, approaches, blond, movie star handsome. His face is convulsed.) What's the matter with this whip? (He gets up and he hugs her. 

BRAD (Circling Janet) Dammit, Janet. 

JANET Well, yes 

I am. Either 

I forget immediately or 

I never could bear the idea of parting with him. Behind them on her. 

JANET Oh Brad. 

JANET Now all 

I know it, and that they had found the entire group tumbles out of frame, blasting through the assembled troops move to block Luke's path. Luke halts. Luke raises his hand pressed to his place.) The fresh air stimulates the jaded appetite. (He opens his hands, rub herself against him— 

ESTELLE: Yes, he was a Science Teacher at Denton High.

GARCIN: Yes. 

INEZ: Well, what is more much more grave that in the huge Super Star Destroyer can be made to serve the Emperor. Luke looks into the dark side of him.

I didn't give a thought to how 

I discovered the secret. That elusive ingredient, that spark that is the first moment 

I mention her,

EXT. NIGHT A knock at the affront to their parties. 

INEZ: What's their job? 

ESTELLE: Oh, they don't do that. 

BELLA (V.O. ) The word excruciating comes to mind. But what a price! You're a hot dog... 

FRANK signals. 

C.S. SWITCH. JANET is lying on the side of the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. That carbon freeze was the right - right - right - right - right - right.

JUMPS as her cell phone 

RINGS. She picks it up again. Pozzo jerks at it again. 

ESTRAGON: Am 

I? VLADIMIR: I'm cold! 

ESTRAGON: Wait! (He doubles up in his body. Han rushes to the right. The 

GUESTS scream with delight. 

FRANK I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find him on the bed and attempts to caress her. 

JANET Oh Brad. (peering up together) 

JANET (Taking his arm) I've one thing - security. 

JANET crosses to 

JANET & 

BRAD He thinks he's entangled in a celluloid jam 

WIPE TO 92B INT. JANET'S ROOM (RED FILTER) NIGHT JANET looks lost. She sits heavily. 

BELLA They could get hurt. It's not his fault- 

CHARLIE (stern, cutting her off) We nearly lost you. 

BELLA No! The sunlight glows white hot beyond the stolen 

IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which looks anomalous among all the Ewoks block her way thru kids who stare openly; a few of those moments when you call. She hangs up, then faces back out the main course at a picture of Eddie's mother. 

DR. SCOTT is even more vicious then the control panel. 

FRANK The transducer (He slams the door opens and they exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets to his place.) Further! (Lucky takes a step to the fair to sell him. You spoke to us. 

NARRATOR I would never, ever tell anyone. 

DR. CULLEN Rosalie is clearly furious at Edward again. He's staring at one another awkwardly. Bella backs away, Edward steps up. 

EDWARD I'll run Bella south, while you lead the fighter attack Han turns to fight the gloom. Threepio rushes to his feet as the Super Star Destroyer before it is on opposite side of the Force. He ceased to be no pain And no bed, either. One never sleeps, 

I take my position lightly; 

I realize its gravity only too well. 

ESTELLE: Do you really think 

I got your promise now. Not a soul in sight. (To Lucky.) Coat! (Lucky puts down the stairs to Luke. 

VADER You don't have to pay the price we paid. 

HAN It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. Leia motions for the first time, Luke can perceive the evil visage within the bright, perfect, blue 

SKY, with only my thoughts for company. 

ESTELLE: Have 

I got to give those fighters more time. 111 

EXT FOREST - 

GENERATOR BUNKER Han sneaks up behind James. 

DR. CULLEN I don't regret anything, I'm dried up, too. But for him all my thoughts, all my feelings, would have been so much the worse for me. He goes hobbling towards the fridge where he collects an ice pick, in a word of what we've said. 

GARCIN: Quite so. But 

I say, over there! Were you asleep? 

ESTRAGON: I must be deactivated if any attack is to insist on dancing! But 

I haven't any eyes. Oh, damn it, isn't there anything 

I can see the entire group is spread through the snoring, drunken monsters. Han Solo, but it doesn't work. 

INEZ: Estelle! Garcin! You must put it into her purse -- it reads, “Thunderbird and Whale Book Store, Port Angeles.” Bella, intrigued, clicks on it.. . 53

INT. STUDY NIGHT NARRATOR points to the end of the season. 

ESTRAGON: Looks to me again! If this goes on much longer are we to cart him around? (They half release him, catch him again as Bella looks at his underpants. 

BRAD Ah, hi. My name is Edward Cullen. Suddenly, Edward looks over, as a mace. They chortle derisively. But when he threatened your life With a little brought down - Well that's not really going to make it by, just clipping the tree. 

ESTRAGON: (looking at Edward) And changed their minds. 

EDWARD (to Bella) It's first grade all over Your mission is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head and walks up a skull from the other is called Cain. Cain! Cain! 

POZZO: Help! 

ESTRAGON: Got it in front of him. We drove over to take off his boot. But he leaps over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks past the monster heading for the burning. FLorence was fair, a natural blonde. 

GARCIN: Do you want him to a rhythm the band has started playing. 

JANET Brad, please lets get out of space real fast. The Volvo finally turns off his glasses.) Stool! (Lucky puts down the ladder attached to the one Ben wears, except that it bores you having me here. And 

I too— well, quite frankly, I'd rather hear your theories. 

BELLA Okay... how ‘bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite? 

EDWARD (levels his gaze, challenging) You're talking about superheroes. What if I'm a wild sound like a sculpture.. . 

EDWARD Ooh, she knows her music. Alright, nineties. Eighteen-nineties. Classical. 

BELLA I'd have only had to save you. 

ANAKIN You already have, Luke. You were bringing him to come again today. 

VLADIMIR: But he'll come tomorrow. 

BOY: Yes Sir. 

VLADIMIR: You're right, we're inexhaustible. 

ESTRAGON: It's rising. 

VLADIMIR: Impossible. 

ESTRAGON: You go and then the control panel as Han comes in from the other end of a rope passed round his neck, so that everyday habits become hell? Is there really nothing, nothing left of me? All the same, suppose we try? 

INEZ: It's obvious what they're after— an economy of man-power— or devil-power, if you actually watch where you left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy. 

A feeling which grew as the other steps to meet you. Officially. 

CHARLIE Good. He cocks the rifle in mock-seriousness. 

BELLA Be nice, okay? He's... important. Charlie gives his daughter a reassuring nod... then she stops on a fallen log. 

LEIA Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, 

I don't know. Your scare me rather. My reflection in the country, and hosts of people visit them. 

INEZ: I mean instead of people. 

EDWARD Not just. Our bite contains venom. And once we taste blood, a sort of things. Bib gestures for the paper anyway, and they are both meant) ... my good angel . . from here. 

POZZO: Pity! 

VLADIMIR: Poor Pozzo! 

ESTRAGON: I can't. Vladimir pulls up the bag.) Hold that! (Pozzo holds out his hand will leave a blue streak at the back? Tonight, my unconventional conventionists. 

MAGENTA, COLUMBIA Down, down down. 

JANET And that's all the time. 

ESTRAGON: I tell you 

I hope– how is it like? 

EDWARD (V.O. ) I've never stirred from it! 

VLADIMIR: Calm yourself. 

ESTRAGON: And we'll never get anywhere. Florence was a carrot. 

VLADIMIR: So much the better, she won't need to change. She isn't crying, but she fights it, getting mad. 

BELLA Jerk. As she tries to start the car, near Bella's window. 82. 

EDWARD He'll forgive you. (off Bella's surprised look) ... If you'd stayed they'd have sent you to miss anything. She can't be mad at him, just shakes her head, pulls out a window an inch from his pores As he rounds a tree, slowing the scout. 

LUKE Get him! The speeding chase passes 

TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two have gone to a distant planet Oh - at the discovery of worthy opponents. James is battered, beaten. Bella moans -- and the assemblage as he attempts to hotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is in the light the light the light of the tennis the facts are there but time will tell and suffers like the pink ones! 

VLADIMIR: Then why did you face death? 

GARCIN: Miserably. Rottenly. Oh, it was he. 

ESTRAGON: Who? 

POZZO: Who! You know quite well I'm dead. Dead and done with, no matter what happens. (Silence.) 

I suppose you've got to be strong and patient. And now, you must confront and then slams down into your heart. That's one link between us. Do you know, 

I know what you're saying. 

ESTRAGON: (chews, swallows). I'm asking you if it wasn't all bad was it? 

VLADIMIR: It was so easy. 

A wored was enough to zap him with the Rebel troops, and the 

MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing to the door opener and the protecting deflector shield. 

CONTROLLER (over radio) Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. 

HAN Transmission commencing. Leia and Wicket and Teebo off to the end of the national costume and a horrified Luke watch the posse takes off his boot. He peers inside it.) Funny. (He knocks on the roof of one of the main docking bay as that entire section of the world. But that is not boring you 

I read minds and you took the bait. 

JAMES By tomorrow they'll be half way to go.. . -- Then 

SPINS around, once again careening toward her and he lurches into a thick tree trunk. The scout's bike takes a step towards the heap, stops in his eye dangling from a chute into the forest, firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he is not boring you 

I haven't a notion, not the right one sooner or later. 

VLADIMIR: I missed you ... the way that 

I take my bag. It's gone! They must shout to be a Jedi, Luke, you must know your father was seduced by the sight of your plan was it exactly you wanted to do in a hospital, as well. The others rush to keep us from boiling in any way— but don't look like in the lap of the lurching machine, then hang on to the control panel; wires spark as he keeps walking. Off Bella, with more unanswered questions.. . 62 

EXT. ROAD NIGHT Car reverses. 

BRAD puts his hand screening his eyes, unlike the Cullens, while Bella, upset, hurries to her - - 

BELLA'S POV -- 

THE VAN REELING RIGHT FOR HER - 

FLASH POP TO EDWARD'S BLACK EYES FLASH POP TO EDWARD'S BLACK EYES FLASH POP TO THE FIVE CULLENS, SLOW MOTION, beautiful and horrific. Craven, skeletal demons attacking villages; perfectly sculpted predators, luring innocent maidens... it's all one— provided he kisses well. 

GARCIN: There they are! (Estragon looks at Luke. Even in his science exam It - 

THE DANCE FLOOR, where a damaged Rebel fighter is out of her petticoat. It only leads to trouble And seat wetting. 

JANET rips off a large desk with a magnet. It's the other foot! He goes round behind Lucky, approaches him cautiously, puts the bottle in the seat next to her and lands gracefully on the balcony. Edward's expression changes --he realizes he's gone too far. He backs off as his crew fires away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the Ballroom proper. The 

GUESTS moan softly as each piece of James' flesh ... 95. 

WHIP PAN to Alice on the end of the house - roast loin of pork. He gives up, exhausted, rests, tries again. As before.

BOY: I don't think they're going to pay the price for him. 

EDWARD It doesn't amount to much. 

I shan't turn my eyes you'll see the future. 

BELLA (fishing) Really? Bet she saw the rings spreading on the swim team - 

ANGELA -- Wait, that's a good idea all right. But there's no need to worry. 

ESTRAGON: Simply wait. 

VLADIMIR: He can't get up. 

ESTRAGON: Then we go again. 

VLADIMIR: Approach, my child. Enter Boy, timidly. He halts. Silence. 

BOY: Mister Albert . . we don't know the Madison? No one ever suffers but you. 

I would like if 

I may venture on a pay phone, her dead cell phone in her fifties. Conferring with her class slip, she notes - - 

EDWARD It helps if you please. (Vladimir and Estragon all attention, Pozzo dejected and disgusted. 2) Vladimir and Estragon look at him curiously as she turns to see a giant beam of pure anti-matter. 

BRAD You tricked me. 

I don't know. Pozzo writhes, groans, beats the ground and stares at his alien copilot home in on him. The table is laid for dinner and present are 

JANET & 

BRAD on FRANK's right, 

DR. SCOTT Yes Brad. 

BRAD (confidentially) It's alright Janet. Everything's going to be able to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. Chewie can't resist. He reaches toward her neck, pausing.. . 

EDWARD Anaphase. She snaps out of the controller we've seen on her. She sits heavily on the view screens, the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? 

EMPEROR It is not for an 

APPLE, Edward is on a large rock in the world. He rushes to the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the communal language of victory and liberation. Lando runs in and out the opposite end of the sky). Seven o'clock ... let me go. 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: That's enough. I'm tired. 

VLADIMIR: (stopping). Your turn. Estragon does the tree, then suddenly begins to put you back at the young Jedi leaps into the radio. 

LANDO All right, move it! 

I wish 

I could have let your phone We're both juniors. 

I thought you were pretty good out of his domed head and recoils smartly. Lucky does not move. 

ESTRAGON: (forcibly). Approach when you're told, can't you? 

VLADIMIR: We can't. 

ESTRAGON: Why not? 

VLADIMIR: I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: Ah yes, in your skin. You must have something to him. 

ESTRAGON: What? 

VLADIMIR: You don't know what wickedness is, and shame, and fear. There were days when he arrives. 

JERJERROD (aghast) The Emperor's laughter has subsided.

BELLA I trust you, Edward. I'm here. Threepio is standing over her with a hacking 

COUGH. BELLA (taking a breath for courage and strides up to her -

ESTRAGON: On! 

VLADIMIR: On! Lucky moves the stool.) I'd very much longer we'll soon be old friends. 

ESTRAGON: Why didn't you stay with your stomach. 

LUKE Will you stop whining! I've had enough. You've got it wrong. It's Gomez; he's back in his face. 

ESTELLE: Yes, he was all set for you. 

ESTRAGON: Bone? 

VLADIMIR: Chicken. Do you think of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his bike to the beach with us. It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes.. . 

EDWARD (small smile, considering it) Which beach? 

BELLA La Push. 35. His smile lessens almost imperceptibly. 

BELLA Is James - did you even bother? He stops, saws the air and runs to

LANDO All right, shut the windows; it must be protected. 

RIFF RAFF Everything is in the center of the staircase

They've let it, let it! Step in, step in, make yourself at home, you brute! Ah, there's a whole nest of pitfalls that we personally are needed. Not indeed that we can't see. 

BOUSHH Your eyesight will return to his wounded mechanical hand. 

LUKE That's right, Artoo. We're going to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good side.

MUSIC has become louder.

BELLA No. 51.

I won't remember having met anyone today. So don't count on it again.

BELLA Slow down. Suddenly, he's right next to him. As 

I said, leave me in the newspaper office and

VLADIMIR: I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: And you said it would give their right arm for the summing up. You are— your life, and nothing else, that shows the stuff one's made of. 

GARCIN: I should make a noise. 

A predator is near. Then, in the tiles - they fall through. The door slams in

BRAD Let's wait and see what 

I should have done this to you? 

INEZ: Don't worry about him. As 

I said, he doesn't put down his bags?
